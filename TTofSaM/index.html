    <div class="post-body" itemprop="articleBody">

      
        <p class="TRSorigin">The <em>Tale of the Sun and Moon</em> is introduced by an ‘Interlude’ (as it is called in the manuscript) in which there appears, as a guest at Mar Vanwa Tyaliéva, one Gilfanon of Tavrobel. This interlude exists also in a rejected earlier version.</p>
<p class="TRStarget">日月传说由一个“插曲”（在手稿中被称为）引入，其中出现了作为 Mar Vanwa Tyaliéva 的客人，塔芙洛贝尔的吉尔法农。这个插曲也存在于被拒绝的早期版本中。</p>
<p class="TRSorigin">The tale itself is for most of its length a manuscript in ink over an erased pencilled original, but towards its end (see <a href="#n_19v">note 19</a>) it becomes a primary manuscript in ink with the pencilled draft extant in another book.</p>
<p class="TRStarget">故事本身的大部分篇幅是用墨水写成的手稿，盖在被擦掉的铅笔原稿上，但到了结尾（见<a href="#n_19v">note 19</a>）时，它变成了一个主要的墨水手稿，铅笔草稿保存在另一本书中。</p>
<p class="TRSorigin">The <em>Tale of the Sun and Moon</em> is very long, and I have shortened it in places in brief paraphrase, without omitting any detail of interest. (A note of my father’s refers to this tale as ‘in need of great revision, cutting-down, and [?reshaping]’.)</p>
<p class="TRStarget">日月传说很长，我在一些地方做了简短的解释，没有遗漏任何有趣的细节。（我父亲的一张纸条将这个故事称为“需要大修、删减和[？重塑]”。）</p>
<p>Gilfanon a·Davrobel</p>
<p class="TRSorigin">Now it is not to be thought that as Eriol hearkened to many tales which spake of divers sorrows of the Elves that the thirst for <em>limpë</em> grew less within him, for it was not so, and ever as the throng sat about the Tale-fire he was an eager questioner, seeking to learn all the history of the folk even down to those days that then were, when the elfin people dwelt again together in the isle.</p>
<p class="TRStarget">现在不要认为，当埃利欧尔听到许多讲述精灵不同悲伤的故事时，他对柔软的渴望变得越来越少，因为事实并非如此，每当人群围坐在故事之火旁时，他是一个热切的提问者，试图了解所有民族的历史，直到那时精灵族再次聚居在岛上。</p>
<p class="TRSorigin">Knowing now therefore something of the glorious fashion of their ancient home and of the splendour of the Gods, he pondered often on the coming of the days of Sunlight and of Moonsheen, and of the doings of the Elves in the world without, and of their adventures there with Men ere Melko compassed their estrangement; wherefore one night he said, sitting before the Tale-fire: ‘Whence be the Sun and Moon, O Lindo? For as yet have I heard only of the Two Trees and their sad fading, but of the coming of Men, or of the deeds of the Elves beyond Valinor has no one told me.’</p>
<p class="TRStarget">因此，现在他知道了他们古老家园的辉煌时尚和众神的辉煌，他经常思考阳光和月光时代的到来，以及精灵在外星世界的所作所为，以及他们的在米尔冦与人类一起冒险之后，他们的疏远就结束了；因此有一天晚上，他坐在火炉前说：“太阳和月亮从哪里来，哦林多？因为到目前为止我只听说过双圣树及其悲惨的消亡，但没有人告诉我人类的到来，或者维林诺以外精灵的事迹。</p>
<p class="TRSorigin">Now there happened that night to be present a guest both at their board and at their tale-telling, and his name was Gilfanon, and all named him beside <span id="l_13"><a href="#l13">Gilfanon a · Davrobel</a></span>,<span id="ch8_en01"><a href="#ch8en01"><sup class="calibre5">1</sup></a></span> for he came from that region of the isle where stands cthe Tower of Tavrobel beside the rivers,<span id="ch8_en02"><a href="#ch8en02"><sup class="calibre5">2</sup></a></span> and about it dwelt the Gnome-folk still as one people, naming the places in their own tongue. That region was Gilfanon wont to <a id="page175"></a>name the fairest of all the isle, and the Gnome-kin its best folk, albeit ere the coming of the folk thither long had he dwelt away from the Noldoli, faring with Ilkorins in Hisilómë and <span id="l_15"><a href="#l15">Artanor</a></span>,<span id="ch8_en03"><a href="#ch8en03"><sup class="calibre5">3</sup></a></span> and thereto had he become as few Elves did a great friend and companion of the Children of Men of those days. To their legends and their memories he added his own knowledge, for he had been deep-versed in many lores and tongues once in the far days of Kôr, and experience had he beside of many very ancient deeds, being indeed one of the oldest of the fairies<span id="ch8_en04"><a href="#ch8en04"><sup class="calibre5">4</sup></a></span> and the most aged that now dwelt in the isle, albeit Meril held the title of Lady of the Isle by reason of her blood.</p>
<p class="TRStarget">那天晚上碰巧在他们的聚会和他们的故事讲述中出现了一位客人，他的名字叫吉尔法农，全名为<a href="#l13">吉尔法农·阿-达芙洛贝尔</a> <a href="#ch8en01">¹</a>，因为他来自岛上的那个地区，那里的河边矗立着塔芙洛贝尔塔<a href="#ch8en02">²</a>，周围的诺姆族仍然作为一个民族居住，用他们自己的语言命名这些地方。那个地区是吉尔法农习惯称其为所有岛屿中最美丽的地方，而 Gnome-kin 是它最好的族群，尽管在族群到来之前很久，他就远离诺多族，在 Hisilómë 和 <a href="#l15">阿塔诺尔</a> <a href="#ch8en03">³</a> 与 Ilkorins 一起生活，至此，他成为了当时极少数成为人类之子的好朋友和伙伴的精灵<a href="#ch8en04">⁴</a>。在他们的传说和记忆中，他添加了自己的知识，因为在科尔的遥远时代，他曾深谙许多传说和语言，除了许多非常古老的事迹外，他还经历过许多非常古老的事迹，他确实是最古老的人之一。现在居住在岛上的最年长的仙灵，尽管弥瑞尔因其血统而获得了岛上女士的头衔。</p>
<p class="TRSorigin">Therefore said Lindo now, answering Eriol: ‘Behold, Gilfanon here can tell thee much of such matters, and it were well if you fared hence away with him to sojourn awhile in Tavrobel.—Nay, look not thus,’ he laughed, seeing Eriol’s face, ‘for we do not banish thee yet—but of a sooth he who would drink of <em>limpë</em> were wise first to seek the guestkindliness of Gilfanon, in whose ancient house—the House of the Hundred Chimneys, that stands nigh <span id="l_16"><a href="#l16">the bridge of Tavrobel</a></span><span id="ch8_en05"><a href="#ch8en05"><sup>5</sup></a></span>—may many things be heard of both past and that are to come.’</p>
<p class="TRStarget">因此，林多现在回答埃利欧尔说：“看哪，吉尔法农在这里可以告诉你很多这样的事情，你最好和他一起离开，在塔芙洛贝尔逗留一段时间。——不，不要这样看，”他笑着说，看到埃利欧尔的脸，“因为我们还没有放逐你——但是，想喝下limpë 的安抚首先是明智地寻求吉尔法农的热情款待，在他古老的房子里——百烟囱之家，就在<a href="#l16">塔芙洛贝尔桥</a> <a href="#ch8en05">⁵</a>的附近。——愿许多过去和未来的事情都能被听到。</p>
<p class="TRSorigin">‘Methinks,’ said Gilfanon to Eriol, ‘that Lindo seeks to rid himself of two guests at once; howso he may not do so yet, for I purpose to stay in Kortirion a sennight yet, and moreover to feast at his good board meanwhile, and stretch me by the Tale-fire too—thereafter maybe thou and I will fare away and thou shalt see the full loveliness of the fairies’ isle—but now let Lindo raise up his voice and tell us yet more of the splendour of the Gods and their works, a theme that never wearies him!’</p>
<p class="TRStarget">“我认为，”吉尔法农对埃利欧尔说，“林多想同时摆脱两个客人；所以他可能还没有这样做，因为我打算在科尔提力安再呆一个晚上，此外还要在他的好饭桌上大快朵颐，并用传说之火舒展我 - 此后也许你和我会离开，你会看看仙灵岛的全部可爱之处——但现在让林多提高嗓门，告诉我们更多关于众神及其作品的辉煌，一个永远不会让他厌倦的主题！</p>
<p class="TRSorigin">At that was Lindo well-pleased, for of a truth he loved to tell such tales and sought often an occasion for recalling them, and said he: ‘Then will I tell the story of the Sun and Moon and of the Stars, that Eriol may hearken to his desire,’ and Eriol was well pleased, but Gilfanon said: ‘Speak on, my Lindo—yet lengthen not the tale for ever.’</p>
<p class="TRStarget">林多对此很高兴，因为事实上他喜欢讲述这样的故事，并经常寻找机会回忆这些故事，并说：“那么我将讲述太阳、月亮和星星的故事，埃利欧尔可能会听从他的愿望，”埃利欧尔很高兴，但吉尔法农说：“说吧，我的林多——但不要永远延长这个故事。</p>
<p class="TRSorigin">Then did Lindo lift up his voice,<span id="ch8_en06"><a href="#ch8en06"><sup class="calibre5">6</sup></a></span> and it was the most pleasant to hearken to of all tale-tellers, and he said:</p>
<p class="TRStarget">然后林多提高了声音<a href="#ch8en06">⁶</a>，他说：</p>
<p class="TRSorigin">‘A tale I tell of that time of the first flight of the Gnomes, and behold they are but newly fled. Now came that grievous news to the Gods and the other Elves, and at first none believed. Nonetheless the tidings came still unto them, and by many different messengers. Some were of the Teleri, who had heard the speech of Fëanor in the square of Kôr and had seen the Noldoli depart thence with all <a id="page176"></a>the goods they might convey; others were of the Solosimpi, and these brought the dire tidings of the swanships’ rape and the dread kinslaughter of the Haven, and the blood that lay on the white shores of Alqaluntë.</p>
<p class="TRStarget">“我讲了一个关于诺姆第一次出奔的故事，看哪，他们刚刚逃走。现在这个可怕的消息传给了众神和其他精灵，起初没有人相信。尽管如此，消息仍然传给他们，而且是由许多不同的使者传来的。有些是泰勒瑞族，他们在科尔广场听到了费艾诺的演讲，并看到诺多带着他们可能运送的所有货物离开了那里。其他人是梭洛辛佩族，这些人带来了关于天鹅船被夺走和天堂可怕的亲族残杀以及澳阔泷潭白色海岸上的鲜血的可怕消息。</p>
<p class="TRSorigin">Lastly came some hotfoot from Mandos who had gazed upon that sad throng nigh the strands of Amnor, and the Gods knew that the Gnomes were far abroad, and Varda and all the Elves wept, for now seemed the darkness black indeed and that more than the outward light of the fair Trees was slain.</p>
<p class="TRStarget">最后从曼督斯传来了一些新消息，他们注视着Amnor海岸附近的那群悲伤的人群，众神知道诺姆在很远的地方，瓦尔妲和所有的精灵都哭了，因为现在看来黑暗确实是黑色的，而且美丽的双圣树之光熄灭了。</p>
<p class="TRSorigin">Strange is to tell that albeit Aulë had loved the Noldoli above all the Elves and had taught them all they knew and given them great stores of wealth, now was his heart most turned against them, for he deemed them ingrate in that they had bidden him no farewell, and for their ill deeds among the Solosimpi he was grieved to the heart.“Speak not,”said he,“the name of the Noldoli ever again unto me,”and albeit he gave still his love to those few faithful Gnomes who remained still about his halls, yet did he name them thereafter“Eldar”.</p>
<p class="TRStarget">奇怪的是，尽管奥力爱诺多胜过所有的精灵，并教给他们他们所知道的一切，并给了他们大量的财富，但现在他的心最反对他们，因为他认为他们忘恩负义，因为他们曾不告而别，并且为他们在梭洛辛佩中的恶行感到悲痛欲绝。“别再说了，”他说，“诺多的名字永远不会再告诉我了。”尽管他仍然爱着那些仍然在他的殿堂周围不动身的少数忠实的诺姆，但他后来还是把他们称为“埃尔达”。</p>
<p class="TRSorigin">But the Teleri and the Solosimpi having wept at first, when the onslaught of the Haven became known to all dried their tears and horror and anguish held their hearts, and they too spake seldom of the Noldoli, save sadly or in whispers behind closed doors; and those few of the Noldoli that remained behind were named <a href="#l26">the Aulenossë</a> or kindred of Aulë, or were taken into the other kindreds, and the Gnome-folk has no place or name remaining now in all Valinor.</p>
<p class="TRStarget">但是泰勒瑞和梭洛辛佩开始哭泣，当所有人都知道港口的猛烈袭击时，他们的眼泪和恐惧和痛苦占据了他们的心，他们也很少谈论诺多族，除了悲伤或关起门来窃窃私语。剩下的少数诺多被称为<a href="#l26">Aulenossë</a>或奥力的眷属，或者被带入其他眷属，而诺姆族裔现在在整个维林诺都没有留下任何位置或名字。</p>
<p class="TRSorigin">Now is it to tell that after a great while it seemed to Manwë that the hunt of the Gods availed nothing, and that surely Melko is now escaped out of Valinor; wherefore he sent Sorontur into the world, and Sorontur came not back for long, and still Tulkas and many others ranged the land, but Manwë stood beside the darkened Trees and his heart was very heavy as he pondered deep and gloomily, but at that time could he see little light of hope. Suddenly there is a sound of wings in that place, for Sorontur King of Eagles is come again on strong wings through the dusk, and behold alighting on the boughs of darkened Silpion he tells how Melko is now broken into the world and many evil spirits are gathered to him:“but,”quoth he,“methinks never more will Utumna open unto him, and already is he busy making himself new dwellings in that region of the North where stand the Iron Mountains very high and terrible to see. Yet O Manwë Lord of the Air, other tidings have I also for thy ear, for lo！as I winged my way homeward hither over the black seas and over the unkindly lands a sight I saw of greatest wonder and amaze: <a id="page177"></a>a fleet of white ships that drifted empty in the gales, and some were burning with bright fires, and as I marvelled behold I saw a great concourse of folk upon the shores of the Great Lands, and they gazed all westward, but some were still wandering in the ice—for know, this was at that place where are the crags of Helkaraksë and the murderous waters of Qerkaringa flowed of old, which now are stopped with ice. Swooping methought I heard the sound of wailing and of sad words spoken in the Eldar tongue; and this tale do I bring to thee for thy unravelling.”</p>
<p class="TRStarget">现在是要告诉曼威，过了很长一段时间后，对众神的追捕似乎毫无用处，而米尔冦现在肯定已经逃出维林诺了。所以他将梭隆图尔送到了这个世界，梭隆图尔没多久就回来了，托卡斯和其他许多人仍然在这片土地上巡视，但曼威站在黑暗的树木旁边，他的心很沉重，他深沉而阴郁地思考着，但那个时候他能看到一点希望的曙光吗？突然，那个地方传来了翅膀的声音，因为鹰王梭隆图尔带着强大的翅膀在黄昏中再次降临，他在黑暗的熙尔皮安的树枝上降落，他讲述了米尔冦现在是如何闯入这个世界的，许多邪恶的灵魂正在聚集到他身边：“但是，”他说，“我认为乌图姆诺再也不会向他开放了，他已经忙着在北方的那个地区建造新的住所，那里的铁山很高，很难看。然而，气之主曼威，我也有其他的消息给你听，看！当我飞过漆黑的大海和不友好的土地向家飞去时，我看到了最令人惊奇和惊奇的景象：一支白色的船队在狂风中空荡荡，有些正在燃烧着明亮的火焰，当我惊叹不已时看啊，我在大地的海岸上看到一大群人，他们都向西凝望，但有些人仍在冰层中徘徊——要知道，这就是赫尔卡拉克的峭壁和凶恶的海水所在的地方。古老的赫尔卡拉克西流淌，现在被冰封住了。突然想到我听到了用埃尔达语说出的哀号和悲伤话语的声音；我要把这个故事带给你，让你解开谜团。”</p>
<p class="TRSorigin">But Manwë knew thereby that the Noldoli were gone for ever and their ships burned or abandoned, and Melko too was in the world, and the hunt of no avail; and belike it is in memory of those deeds that it has ever been a saying in the mouths of Elves and Men that those burn their boats who put all hope from them of change of mind or counsel. Therefore now Manwë lifted up his unmeasurable voice calling to the Gods, and all those about the wide lands of Valinor hearkened and returned.</p>
<p class="TRStarget">但曼威由此知道诺多永远消失了，他们的船只被烧毁或被遗弃，而米尔冦也在这个世界上，但追捕无济于事。就像是为了纪念这些事迹，精灵和人类口中的一句话是那些烧毁他们的船的人，他们把所有希望都寄托在他们改变主意或建议上。因此，现在曼威提高了他无法测量的声音呼唤众神，维林诺广袤土地上的所有人都听了并返回。</p>
<p class="TRSorigin">There first came Tulkas weary and dust-covered, for none had leapt about that plain as he. Seven times had he encompassed all its width and thrice had he scaled the mountain-wall, and all those measureless slopes and pastures, meads and forests, he had traversed, burnt by his desire to punish the spoiler of Valinor. There came Lórien and leaned against the withered bole of Silpion, and wept the wrack of his quiet gardens by the trampling hunt; there too was Meássë and with her Makar, and his hand was red for he had come upon twain of Melko’s comrades as they fled, and he slew them as they ran, and he alone had aught of joy in those ill times. Ossë was there and his beard of green was torn and his eyes were dim, and he gasped leaning on a staff and was very much athirst, for mighty as he was about the seas and tireless, such desperate travail on the bosom of Earth spent his vigour utterly.</p>
<p class="TRStarget">疲惫不堪、满身灰尘的托卡斯首先来到了这里，因为没有人像他一样在这片平原上跳跃过。他曾七次绕过它的全部宽度，三次攀登过山墙，以及所有那些无边无际的山坡和牧场，草地和森林，他已经被他惩罚维林诺破坏者的欲望所燃烧。罗瑞恩来了，靠在熙尔皮安枯萎的树干上，在狩猎的践踏中哭泣着他安静的花园的残骸；还有美亚西和她的玛卡尔，他的手是红色的，因为他在米尔冦逃跑的时候遇到了他们的两个同伴，在他们逃跑的时候他杀死了他们，只有他一个人在那些病痛的日子里充满了快乐。欧西在那儿，他的绿色胡须被撕破，眼睛昏暗，他靠在一根拐杖上喘着粗气，非常口渴，因为他在大海中强大，不知疲倦，在大地的怀抱中如此绝望的劳作花费了他的生命。活力十足。</p>
<p class="TRSorigin">Salmar and Ómar stood by and their instruments of music made no sound and they were heavy of heart, yet not so bitterly as was Aulë, lover of the earth and of all things made or gained by good labour therefrom, for of all the Gods he had loved Valmar most wholly and Kôr and all their treasures, and the smile of the fair plains without, and its ruin cut his heart. With him was Yavanna, Earth-queen, and she had hunted with the Gods and was spent; but Vána and Nessa wept as maidens still beside the founts of gold Kulullin.</p>
<p class="TRStarget">萨尔玛和欧玛站在一旁，他们的乐器没有声音，他们的心情很沉重，但不像奥力那样痛苦，他热爱大地和通过良好劳动创造或获得的所有事物，因为他对所有的神曾经最全心全意地爱着维尔玛、科尔和他们所有的宝藏，外面美丽的平原的微笑和它的毁灭让他心碎。和他在一起的还有大地女王雅凡娜，她曾与众神一起追捕，但她已经精疲力尽了。但瓦娜和奈莎在金Kulullin的泉水旁像少女一样哭泣。</p>
<p class="TRSorigin">Ulmo alone came not to the Trees, but went down to the beach of Eldamar, and there he stood gazing into the gloom far out to <a id="page178"></a>sea, and he called often with his most mighty voice as though he would draw back those truants to the bosom of the Gods, and whiles he played deep longing music on his magic conches, and to him alone, <span id="l_19"><a href="#l19">lest it be</a></span><span id="ch8_en07"><a href="#ch8en07"><sup>7</sup></a></span> Varda lady of the stars, was the going of the Gnomes a greater grief than even the ruin of the Trees. Aforetime had Ulmo loved the Solosimpi very dearly, yet when he heard of their slaughter by the Gnomes he grieved indeed but anger hardened not his heart, <span id="l_41">for Ulmo was foreknowing</span> more than all the Gods, even than great Manwë, and perchance he saw many of the things that should spring from that flight and the dread pains of the unhappy Noldoli in the world, and the anguish wherewith they would expiate the blood of Kópas, and he would that it need not be.</p>
<p class="TRStarget">乌欧牟一个人没有来到森林，而是来到了埃尔达玛海滩，他站在那里凝视着远处大海的阴暗，他经常用最强大的声音呼唤，好像他要把那些逃离的人拉回怀里诸神之歌，而他在他的魔法海螺上演奏着深沉渴望的音乐，只对他一个人来说，星之女神瓦尔妲很忧虑<a href="#ch8en07">⁷</a>，诺姆的离去比树木的毁灭更令人悲痛。乌欧牟从前非常热爱梭洛辛佩族，但当他听到他们被诺姆屠杀的消息时，他确实感到悲痛，但愤怒并没有让他的心变得刚硬，因为乌欧牟比所有的神明都早知道，甚至比伟大的曼威还要早，而且他可能看到了许多应该从那次出奔中产生的东西和世界上不幸的诺多的可怕痛苦，以及他们将用它们来弥补科帕斯的鲜血的痛苦，他希望它不必如此。</p>
<p class="TRSorigin">Now when all were thus come together, then spake Manwë to them and told the tidings of Sorontur and how the chase had failed, but at that time the Gods were wildered in the gloom and had little counsel, and sought each one his home and places of old delight now dead, and there sat in silence and dark pondering. Yet some fared ever and anon out upon the plain and gazed wistfully at the faded Trees as though those withered boughs would one day burgeon with new light: but this came not to pass, and Valinor was full of shadows and of gloom, and the Elves wept and could not be comforted, and the Noldoli had bitter sorrow in the northern lands.</p>
<p class="TRStarget">现在，当所有人都这样聚集在一起时，然后曼威对他们说话，并告诉他们梭隆图尔的消息以及追捕是如何失败的，但当时众神在黑暗中疯狂，几乎没有任何建议，并且每个人都寻找他的家和地方昔日的喜悦现在已经死去，静静地坐在那儿，在黑暗中沉思。然而，有些人却时不时地在平原上徘徊，渴望地凝视着枯萎的树木，好像那些枯萎的树枝有一天会以新的光芒绽放：但这并没有发生，维林诺充满了阴影和阴霾，而精灵们哭泣无法安抚，诺多族在北方大地悲痛欲绝。</p>
<p class="TRSorigin">Thereafter in a great time it pierced the grief and the weariness of the Gods that light is gone from Valinor for ever, and that never again will those Trees bloom again at their appointed times. Only the light of the stars remained, save where a glow lay about the fountain of Kulullin playing still or a pale gleam lingered nigh deep <span id="l_20"><a href="#l20">Telimpë</a></span>,<span id="ch8_en08"><a href="#ch8en08"><sup>8</sup></a></span> vat of dreams. Yet even these were dimmed and tarnished, for the Trees bore dew no more for their replenishment.</p>
<p class="TRStarget">此后，在一段伟大的时间里，光从维林诺永远消失了，双圣树再也不会在指定的时间再次开花，这让众神感到悲伤和疲倦。只剩下星星的光亮，除了在Kulullin喷泉周围闪耀的光芒，或者在泰利姆佩<a href="#ch8en08">⁸</a>附近徘徊的苍白微光，和梦境的桶。然而，即使是这些也变得黯淡无光，因为双圣树不再为它们的补充而结露。</p>
<p class="TRSorigin">Wherefore does Vána arise and seek Lórien, and with them go Urwendi and Silmo<span id="ch8_en09"><a href="#ch8en09"><sup>9</sup></a></span> and many of both Vali and the Elves; and they gather much light of gold and silver in great vessels and fare sadly to the ruined Trees. There singeth Lórien most wistful songs of magic and enchantment about the stock of Silpion, and he bid water his roots with the radiance of Telimpë and this was lavishly done, albeit small store thereof remained now in the dwellings of the Gods. In like manner doth Vána, and she sings old golden songs of the happier days, and bids her maidens dance their bright dances even such as they were used to dance upon the sward of the rose-gardens nigh Kulullin, and as they danced she flooded the roots of Laurelin with streams from out her golden jars.</p>
<p class="TRStarget">瓦娜为何起来寻找罗瑞恩，与他们一同前往的阿瑞恩和熙尔牟<a href="#ch8en09">⁹</a>以及许多维拉和精灵；他们在大器皿中收集了大量金银之光，悲惨地走向毁灭的树木。罗瑞恩唱起了关于熙尔皮安的魔法和魔法的最渴望的歌曲，他用泰利姆佩的光辉浇灌根，这做得很奢侈，尽管现在只有一小部分储存在众神的住所中。瓦娜也是如此，她唱着幸福岁月中古老的金曲，并吩咐她的少女跳她们明亮的舞蹈，就像她们在Kulullin附近的玫瑰园的草地上跳舞时那样，当她们跳舞时，她淹没了劳瑞林的根，从她的金罐里流出。</p>
<p class="TRSorigin">Yet all their singing and enchantment is of little worth, and <a id="page179"></a>though the roots of the Trees seem to drink all that they may pour yet can they see no stir of life renewed nor faintest gleam of light; nor withered leaf glows with sap nor blossom lifts its drooping stem. Indeed in the frenzy of their grief they had poured out all the last remaining stores of brightness that the Gods retained, had not of a fortune Manwë and Aulë come upon them in that hour, being drawn thither by their singing in the gloom, and stayed them, saying:“Lo, O Vána, and thou O Lórien, what is this rashness? And wherefore did ye not first take counsel of your brethren? For know ye not that that which ye spill unthinking upon the earth is become more precious than all the things the world contains; and when it is gone perchance not all the wisdom of the Gods may get us more.”</p>
<p class="TRStarget">然而，他们所有的歌声和魔力都毫无价值，尽管双圣树的根似乎喝尽了他们可能倾倒的一切，但他们看不到生命的更新，也看不到最微弱的光芒。枯叶不会因汁液而发光，花朵也不会抬起下垂的茎。的确，在他们悲痛欲绝的情况下，他们倾倒了众神所保留的所有最后剩余的光明，曼威和奥力在那一刻没有幸运地来到他们身边，被他们在黑暗中的歌声吸引到那里，并留下来他们说：“哦，哦，瓦娜，还有你，罗瑞安，这是什么鲁莽行为？你们为什么不先征求弟兄们的意见呢？因为你们不知道，你们不假思索地洒在大地上的东西比世界上的一切都更珍贵；当它消失时，也许并不是神的所有智慧都能让我们得到更多。”</p>
<p class="TRSorigin">Then Vána said:“Pardon, O Manwë Súlimo, and let my sorrow and my tears be my excuse; yet aforetime did this draught fail never to refresh the heart of Laurelin, and she bare ever in return a fruit of light more plentiful than we gave; and methought the Gods sat darkly in their halls and for the weight of their grief essayed no remedy of their ills. But behold now have Lórien and I put forth our spells and nought may they avail,”and Vána wept.</p>
<p class="TRStarget">然后瓦娜说：“请原谅，曼威·苏利牟，让我的悲伤和眼泪成为我的借口；然而，从前这从未让劳瑞林的心焕然一新，而作为回报，她也收获了比我们给予的更丰富的光明果实。想到众神黑暗地坐在他们的殿堂里，由于他们的悲痛，无法治愈他们的病痛。但看哪，现在有罗瑞恩和我施展了我们的咒语，但它们却无济于事，”瓦娜哭了。</p>
<p class="TRSorigin">Now was it the thought of many that those twain Lórien and Vána might not avail to heal the wounds of Laurelin and Silpion, in that no word of the Earth-lady, mother of magics, was mingled in their spells. Therefore many said: “Let us seek Palúrien, for of her magic maybe these Trees shall again know some portion of their ancient glory—and then if light be renewed Aulë and his craftsmen may repair the hurts of our fair realm, and happiness will be once more <span id="l_21"><a href="#l21">twixt Erumáni and the Sea</a></span>”<span id="ch8_en10"><a href="#ch8en10"><sup>10</sup></a></span>—but of the darkness and ill days that had long been without the hills few recked or thought.</p>
<p class="TRStarget">现在很多人都在想，罗瑞恩和瓦娜这对双胞胎可能无法治愈劳瑞林和罗瑞恩的伤口，因为他们的咒语中没有混入大地女士，魔法之母的话。因此许多人说：“让我们寻找帕露瑞恩，因为她的魔法也许这些树会再次知道它们古老荣耀的一部分——然后，如果光能重新焕发，奥力和他的工匠可以修复我们美丽国度的伤痛，幸福就会降临。再一次在Erumáni 和海之间”<a href="#ch8en10">¹⁰</a>——但那些早已没有山丘的黑暗和痛苦的日子，很少有人想到或想到。</p>
<p class="TRSorigin">Now therefore they called for Yavanna, and she came and asked them what they would, and hearing she wept and spake before them, saying:“Know ye, O Valar, and ye sons and daughters of the Eldar, Children of Ilúvatar, first offspring of the forests of the Earth, that never may these Two Trees bloom again, and others like them may not be brought to life for many many ages of the world. Many things shall be done and come to pass, and the Gods grow old, and the Elves come nigh to fading, ere ye shall see the rekindling of these Trees or the Magic Sun relit,”and the Gods knew not what she meant, speaking of the Magic Sun, nor did for a long while after. But Tulkas hearing said:“Why speakest thou these words, O Kémi Palúrien, for foretelling is not thy wont, and that of evil least of all?”And others there were who said:“Ay, and never before has Kémi <a id="page180"></a>the Earth-lady been hard of counsel or lacked a spell of deepest virtue,”and they besought her to put forth her power. But Yavanna said:“’Tis of fate and the Music of the Ainur. Such marvels as those Trees of gold and silver may even the Gods make but once, and that in the youth of the world; nor may all my spells avail to do what ye now ask.”</p>
<p class="TRStarget">因此，他们呼唤雅凡娜，她来问他们要做什么，听到她的声音，她在他们面前哭泣着说：“哦，维拉，你们要认识，你们埃尔达的儿女，伊露维塔的孩子，初代大地上的森林，希望这双圣树永远不会再次开花，而像它们一样的其他树可能在世界许多时代都不会复活。许多事情将要完成并成为现实，众神会变老，而精灵则会濒临消亡，在你们看到双圣树重新点燃或魔法太阳重新点燃之前，”众神不明白她的意思，说魔法太阳的，好久没有了。但托卡斯听到后说：“Kémi帕露瑞恩，你为什么说这些话，因为预言不是你的习惯，最不习惯是邪恶？”还有其他人说：“是的，大地女士凯米从来没有对人提出过严格的建议或缺乏最深沉的美德，”他们恳求她发挥她的力量。但雅凡娜说：“这是命运和爱努的音乐。像那些金银之树一样的奇迹，即使是众神也只能创造一次，而且在世界的青年时期；我所有的咒语都不能满足你现在的要求。”</p>
<p class="TRSorigin">Then said Vána:“How then sayest thou, Aulë, mighty contriver, who art called <em>i·Talka Marda</em>—Smith of the World—for the might of thy works, how are we to obtain light that is needful to our joy? For what is Valinor without light, or what art thou an thou losest thy skill, as, meseems, in this hour thy spouse has done?”</p>
<p class="TRStarget">瓦娜接着说：“那么，你怎么说，奥力，伟大的发明家，被称为 i·Talka Marda——世界的铁匠——为了你的作品的力量，我们如何获得我们快乐所需的光？因为没有光的维林诺是什么，或者你失去了你的技能，就像你的配偶在这个时刻所做的那样？”</p>
<p class="TRSorigin">“Nay,”said Aulë,“light may not be fashioned by smithcraft, O Vána-Laisi, nor can any even of the Gods devise it, if the sap of the Trees of wonder be dried for ever.”But Palúrien answering also said:“Lo, O Tuivána, and ye beside of the Vali and of the Elves, think ye only and always of Valinor, forgetting the world without?—for my heart saith to me that already were it time for the Gods to take up once more the battle for the world and expel therefrom the powers of Melko ere they be waxen to o’erwhelming strength.”But Vána comprehended not Palúrien’s mind, thinking only of her Tree of gold, and she abode ill-content; but Manwë and Varda, and with them Aulë and Yavanna, fared thence, and in secret conclave they took deep and searching counsel one of another, and at the last they bethought them of a rede of hope. Then did Manwë call together all the folk of Valinor once more; and that great throng was gathered even in Vána’s bower amidst her roses, where Kulullin’s fountains were, for the plain without lay now all cold and dark. There came even the leaders of the Elves and sat at the feet of the Gods, nor had that before been done; but when all were come together Aulë arose and said:“Hearken ye all. A rede has Manwë Súlimo Valatúru to declare, and the mind of the Earth-lady and of the Queen of the Stars is therein, nor yet is my counsel absent.”</p>
<p class="TRStarget">“不，”奥力说，“光可能不是用铁匠制造的，哦瓦娜-Laisi，如果奇迹之树的汁液永远干涸，即使是神也无法设计它。”但帕卢里安也回答说：“哦，图伊瓦娜，除了维拉和精灵之外，你只想永远只考虑维林诺，忘记外面的世界吗？——因为我的心告诉我，现在是时候众神再次为世界而战，并在他们变得强大到压倒性的力量之前将米尔冦的力量从那里驱逐出去。”但瓦娜不理解帕露瑞恩的心意，只想着她的黄金之树，她的生活很不满足。但曼威和瓦尔妲，以及奥力和雅凡娜与他们一起从那里出发，在秘密会议上，他们彼此进行了深入而深思熟虑的建议，最后他们想到了希望。然后曼威再次召集了维林诺的所有人。大群人甚至聚集在瓦娜的玫瑰花丛中，那里有Kulullin的喷泉，因为外面的平原现在一片寒冷和黑暗。甚至精灵的领袖也来了，坐在众神的脚下，以前也没有过这样的事。但当所有人都聚集在一起时，奥力站起来说：“你们都听我的。一个救赎由曼威·苏利牟，维拉之主宣布，大地女士和群星女王的思想在其中，我的建议也没有缺席。”</p>
<p class="TRSorigin">Then was there a great silence that Manwë might speak, and he said:“Behold O my people, a time of darkness has come upon us, and yet I have it in mind that this is not without the desire of Ilúvatar. For the Gods had well-nigh forgot the world that lies without expectant of better days, and of Men, Ilúvatar’s younger Sons that soon must come. Now therefore are the Trees withered that so filled our land with loveliness and our hearts with mirth that wider desires came not into them, and so behold, we must turn now <a id="page181"></a>our thoughts to new devices whereby light may be shed upon both the world without and Valinor within.”</p>
<p class="TRStarget">然后是一片巨大的沉默，曼威可能会说话，他说：“看啊，我的人民，黑暗的时代已经降临到我们身上，但我认为这并非没有伊露维塔的愿望。因为众神几乎忘记了这个谎言的世界，没有期待更好的日子，也忘记了人类，伊露维塔的次生子们很快就会到来。因此，现在树木枯萎了，使我们的土地充满了可爱，我们的心充满了欢乐，以至于没有更广泛的欲望进入它们，因此，看啊，我们现在必须将我们的思想转向新的装置，从而可以将光照射到外面的世界和里面的维林诺。”</p>
<p class="TRSorigin">Then told he them concerning those stores of radiance they still possessed; for of silver light they had no great store save only that that yet lay in Telimpë, and a lesser measure that Aulë had in basons in his smithy. Some indeed had the Eldar lovingly saved in tiny vessels as it flowed and wasted in the soils about the stricken bole, but it was little enough.</p>
<p class="TRStarget">然后告诉他关于他们仍然拥有的那些光辉储备；因为他们没有大量的银光储备，只有在泰利姆佩尚存的银光，以及奥力在他的锻造工坊的盆中存有的少量银光。有些人确实将精灵族人亲切地保存在小容器中，因为它在受灾的树干周围的土壤中流动和浪费，但这还不够。</p>
<p class="TRSorigin">Now the smallness of their store of white light was due to many causes, in that Varda had used greatly of it when she kindled mighty stars about the heavens, both at the coming of the Eldar and at other times. Moreover that Tree Silpion bore dew of light less richly far than Laurelin had been wont to do, and nonetheless, for it was less hot and fiery-subtle, did the Gods and Elves have need of it always in their magic crafts, and had mingled it with all manner of things that they devised, and in this were the Noldoli the chief.</p>
<p class="TRStarget">现在，他们的白光储存量如此之小是由多种原因造成的，因为瓦尔妲在点燃天空中强大的星辰时大量使用了它，无论是在精灵族降临时还是其他时候。此外，熙尔皮安树所散发的光露远没有劳瑞林的那样浓郁，尽管如此，由于它不那么炽热和火热微妙，神和精灵在他们的魔法工艺中总是需要它，并且已经混合他们设计了各种各样的东西，其中包括诺多族首领。</p>
<p class="TRSorigin">Now golden light not even the Gods could tame much to their uses, and had suffered it to gather in the great vat Kulullin to the great increase of its fountains, or in other bright basons and wide pools about their courts, for the health and glory of its radiance was very great. ’Tis said indeed that those first makers of jewels, of whom Fëanor has the greatest fame, alone of the Eldar knew the secret of subtly taming golden light to their uses, and they dared use their knowledge but very sparingly, and now is that perished with them out of the Earth. Yet even of this golden radiance was there no unfailing source, now that Laurelin dripped her sweet dew no more. Of this necessity did Manwë shape his plan, and it was caught from that very sowing of the stars that Varda did of yore; for to each of the stars had she given a heart of silver flame set in vessels of crystals and pale glass and unimagined substances of faintest colours: and these vessels were some made like to boats, and buoyed by their hearts of light they fared ever about Ilwë, yet could they not soar into the dark and tenuous realm of Vaitya that is outside all. Now winged spirits of the utmost purity and beauty—even the most ethereal of those bright choirs of the Mánir and the Súruli who fare about the halls of Manwë on Taniquetil or traverse all the airs that move upon the world—sate in those starry boats and guided them on mazy courses high above the Earth, and Varda gave them names, but few of these are known.</p>
<p class="TRStarget">现在，即使是众神也无法驯服它们的金光，为了健康和荣耀，它们不得不聚集在Kulullin的大缸中以增加其喷泉的数量，或者在其他明亮的盆地和庭院周围的宽阔水池中它的光辉非常大。确实有人说，费艾诺最有名的那些珠宝的第一制造者，只有精灵族知道巧妙地驯服金光以供他们使用的秘诀，他们敢于使用他们的知识，但非常谨慎，现在他们已经灭亡了和他们一起离开大地。然而，即使是这金色的光芒也没有永恒的源泉，现在劳瑞林不再滴下她的甘露了。出于这种需要，曼威制定了他的计划，而它正是从瓦尔妲过去所做的那颗星星的播种中得到的。因为她给了每颗星星一颗银色火焰的心，镶嵌在水晶、浅色玻璃和难以想象的最微弱颜色的物质的容器中：这些容器有些像船一样，在它们的光心的推动下，它们一直在航行伊尔威，但他们不能翱翔到外在的黑暗和脆弱的 Vaitya 领域。现在，拥有最纯洁和美丽的翅膀的灵魂——即使是那些在塔尼魁提尔上的曼威殿堂中巡游或穿越世界上所有空气的 Mánir 和 Súruli 明亮的合唱团中最空灵的灵魂——在那些满天星斗和引导他们走上大地上空的迷宫路线，瓦尔妲给他们起了名字，但鲜为人知。</p>
<p class="TRSorigin">Others there were whose vessels were like translucent lamps set quivering above the world, in Ilwë or on the very confines of Vilna and the airs we breathe, and they flickered and waned for the stirring <a id="page182"></a>of the upper winds, yet abode where they hung and moved not; and of these some were very great and beautiful and the Gods and Elves among all their riches loved them; and thence indeed the jewel-makers catch their inspiration. Not least did they love Morwinyon of the west, whose name meaneth the glint at dusk, and of his setting in the heavens much has been told; and of Nielluin too, who is the Bee of Azure, Nielluin whom still may all men see in autumn or in winter burning nigh the foot of Telimektar son of Tulkas whose tale is yet to tell.</p>
<p class="TRStarget">其他人的器皿就像半透明的灯，在世界上空颤抖，在伊尔威或Vilna的边界和我们呼吸的空气，它们在上风的吹拂下忽明忽暗，但仍停留在它们悬挂和移动的地方不是;其中一些非常伟大和美丽，众神和精灵在他们所有的财富中都爱他们。确实，珠宝制造商从那里获得了灵感。他们尤其喜欢西方的莫温扬，他的名字的意思是黄昏时分的闪光，关于他在天上的位置，人们已经听说了很多。还有赫尔路因，他是蓝蜂，赫尔路因仍然可以让所有人在秋天或冬天看到它在托卡斯的儿子泰理梅克塔脚下燃烧，他的故事尚未讲述。</p>
<p class="TRSorigin">But lo！(said Lindo) the beauty of the stars hath drawn me far afield, and yet I doubt not in that great speech, the mightiest Manwë ever spake before the Gods, mention he made of them yet more loving than was mine. <a href="#l23">For behold</a>, he desired in this manner to bring the hearts of the Gods to consider his design, and having spoken of the stars he shaped thus his final words:“Behold,”said Manwë,“this is now the third essay of the Gods to bring light into dark places, and both the Lamps of the North and South, and the Trees of the plain, Melko hath brought to ruin. Now in the air only hath Melko no power for ill, wherefore it is my rede that we build a great vessel brimming with golden light and the hoarded dews of Laurelin, and this do set afloat like a mighty ship high above the dark realms of the Earth. There shall it thread far courses through the airs and pour its light on all the world twixt Valinórë and the Eastern shores.”</p>
<p class="TRStarget">但是看！（林多说）星星的美丽把我拉到了很远的地方，但我毫不怀疑在那个伟大的演讲中，最强大的曼威曾经在众神面前说过，他提到他们比我的更有爱心。因为看啊，他希望以这种方式让众神考虑他的计划，在谈到星辰后，他如此塑造了他的最后一句话：“看啊，”曼威说，“这是众神的第三篇文章为了将光明带入黑暗的地方，北方和南方的灯，以及平原的树木，米尔冦已经毁灭了。现在在空中，只有米尔冦没有作恶的能力，因此我希望我们建造一艘充满金色光芒和劳瑞林积聚的露水的大船，这确实像一艘强大的船一样漂浮在黑暗的国度之上。大地。它将在那里穿过遥远的天空，将它的光芒倾注在维林诺和东海岸之间的所有世界上。”</p>
<p class="TRSorigin">Now Manwë designed the course of the ship of light to be between the East and West, for Melko held the North and Ungweliant the South, whereas in the West was Valinor and the blessed realms, and in the East great regions of dark lands that craved for light.</p>
<p class="TRStarget">现在曼威将光之船的航道设计在东方和西方之间，因为米尔冦控制着北方，而乌格威立安提则控制着南方，而西方则是维林诺和受祝福的国度，而东方则是大片渴望的黑暗土地为光。</p>
<p class="TRSorigin">Now it is said (quoth Lindo) that, whereas certain of the Gods of their divine being might, an they wished, fare with a great suddenness of speed through Vilna and the low airs, yet might none even of the Valar, not Melko himself, nor any other save Manwë and Varda and their folk alone avail to pass beyond: for this was the word of Ilúvatar when he sped them to the world at their desire, that they should dwell for ever within the world if once they entered it, nor should leave it, until its Great End came, being woven about it in the threads of its fate and becoming part thereof. Yet more, to Manwë alone, knowing the purity and glory of his heart, did Ilúvatar grant the power of visiting the uttermost heights; and breathing the great clear Serene which lies so far above the world that no finest dust of it, nor thinnest odour of its lives, nor faintest echo of its song or sorrow comes there; but far below it gleams palely beneath the stars and the shadows of the Sun and Moon faring back and forth <a id="page183"></a>from Valinor flutter upon its face. There walks Manwë Súlimo often far out beyond the stars and watches it with love, and he is very near the heart of Ilúvatar.</p>
<p class="TRStarget">现在据说（林多说），尽管他们的某些神灵可能，如他们所愿，以极大的突然速度穿越Vilna和低空，但即使是维拉也不可能，米尔冦本人也不可能，除了曼威和瓦尔妲和他们的同胞之外，任何其他人都无法超越：因为这是伊露维塔根据他们的意愿将他们飞向世界时所说的话，如果他们一旦进入世界，他们将永远居住在这个世界中，也不应该离开它，直到它的大结局到来，在它的命运之线中被编织并成为它的一部分。更重要的是，只有曼威知道自己内心的纯洁和荣耀，伊露维塔才授予他访问至高无上的力量；呼吸着远在世界上空的清澈的宁静，没有最细微的尘埃，没有最微弱的生命气味，也没有最微弱的歌声或悲伤的回声；但在远处，它在繁星之下闪烁着苍白的光芒，日月在维林诺来回飘动的阴影在它的脸上飘动。曼威·苏利牟经常在星辰之外远行，带着爱意注视着它，他离伊露维塔的心脏很近。</p>
<p class="TRSorigin">But this has ever been and is yet the greatest bitterness to Melko, for in no wise of himself could he now forsake the bosom of the Earth, and belike ye shall yet hear how mightily his envy was increased when the great vessels of radiance set sail; but now is it to tell that so moving were the words and so great their wisdom that<span id="ch8_en11"><a href="#ch8en11"><sup>11</sup></a></span> the most part of the Gods thought his purpose good, and they said: “Let Aulë busy himself then with all his folk in the fashioning of this ship of light”, and few said otherwise, though ’tis told that Lórien was little pleased, fearing lest shadow and quiet and secret places ceased to be, and of a surety Vána might think of little else for the greatness of her vain desire to see the rekindling of the Trees.</p>
<p class="TRStarget">但这一直是，现在仍然是米尔冦最大的痛苦，因为他现在无论如何也不能放弃大地的怀抱，而且当光辉的大船启航时，你似乎还会听到他的嫉妒是多么强烈;但现在要说的是，这些话是如此动人，他们的智慧如此之大<a href="#ch8en11">¹¹</a>，以至于大多数众神都认为他的目的是好的，他们说：“那就让奥力和他的所有人民一起忙于建造这艘光之船吧”，很少有人说不，尽管有人告诉罗瑞恩不太高兴，害怕阴影和安静和秘密的地方不复存在，而瓦娜可能会因为她渴望看到重新点燃树木的荣耀而想不到其他任何事情。</p>
<p class="TRSorigin">Then said Aulë:“The task ye set me is of the utmost difficulty, yet will I do all that I may therein,”and he begged the aid of Varda the starfashioner, and those twain departed and were lost in the gloom a great while.</p>
<p class="TRStarget">然后奥力说：“你给我的任务是最困难的，但我会尽我所能，”他请求星际设计师瓦尔妲的帮助，他们俩离开了，在黑暗中迷失了很长一段时间.</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="TRSorigin">The narrative continues with an account of the failure of Aulë and Varda to devise any substance that was not ‘too gross to swim the airs or too frail to bear the radiance of Kulullin’ and when this was made known Vána and Lórien asked that, since Manwë’s design had failed, he should command Yavanna to attempt the healing of the Trees.</p>
<p class="TRStarget">叙述继续讲奥力和瓦尔妲未能设计出任何“不至于在空中游泳或过于脆弱而无法承受Kulullin的光辉”的物质，当这件事被公开时，瓦娜和罗瑞恩问道，因为曼威的计划失败了，他应该命令雅凡娜尝试治愈树木。</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="TRSorigin">At length therefore did Manwë bid Yavanna to put forth her power, and she was loath, but the clamour of the folk constrained her, and she begged for some of the radiance of white and gold; but of this would Manwë and Aulë spare only two small phials, saying that if the draught of old had power to heal the Trees already had they been blooming, for Vána and Lórien had poured it unstintingly upon their roots. Then sorrowfully Yavanna stood upon the plain and her form trembled and her face was very pale for the greatness of the effort that her being put forth, striving against fate. The phial of gold she held in her right hand and the silver in her left, and standing between the Trees she lifted them on high, and flames of red and of white arose from each like flowers, and the ground shook, and the earth opened, and a growth of flowers and plants leapt up therefrom about her feet, white and blue about her left side and red and gold about her right, and the Gods sat still and in amaze. Then going she cast each phial upon its proper Tree and sang the songs of unfading growth and a song of resurrection after death and withering; and suddenly she sang no more. Midway she stood between the <a id="page184"></a>Trees and utter silence fell, then there was a great noise heard and none knew what passed, but Palúrien lay swooning on the Earth; but many leapt beside her and raised her from the ground, and she trembled and was afraid.</p>
<p class="TRStarget">最终，曼威命令雅凡娜发挥她的力量，她很不情愿，但人们的喧嚣约束了她，她乞求一些白色和金色的光芒。但对此，曼威和奥力只放了两个小药瓶，说如果古老的药水能够治愈树木，它们已经开花了，因为瓦娜和罗瑞恩已经把它毫不吝啬地倒在了它们的根上。然后雅凡娜悲伤地站在平原上，她的身子颤抖着，她的脸因她与命运抗争所付出的巨大努力而变得苍白。她右手拿着金瓶，左手拿着银瓶，站在双圣树之间，把它们高高举起，红色和白色的火焰像花朵一样从每个地方升起，大地震动，大地裂开，一丛花草从她的脚边长出来，左边是白色和蓝色，右边是红色和金色，众神静静地坐着，惊叹不已。然后，她将每一个小瓶都扔在它的合适的树上，唱着不朽的成长之歌和一首死后和枯萎后的复活之歌；突然间，她不再唱歌了。中途，她站在双圣树之间，一片寂静，接着传来一声巨响，没人知道发生了什么，但帕露瑞恩倒在地上昏迷不醒。但有许多人跳到她身边，把她从地上扶起来，她颤抖着害怕。</p>
<p class="TRSorigin">“Vain, O children of the Gods,”she cried,“is all my strength. Lo, at your desire I have poured my power upon the Earth like water, and like water the Earth has sucked it from me—it is gone and I can do no more.”And the Trees stood still gaunt and stark, and all the companies wept beholding her, but Manwë said:“Weep not, O children of the Gods, the irreparable harm, for many fair deeds may be yet to do, and beauty hath not perished on the earth nor all the counsels of the Gods been turned to nought”but nonetheless folk left that place in sorrow, save Vána only, and she clung to the bole of Laurelin and wept.</p>
<p class="TRStarget">“诸神之子啊，徒劳，”她喊道，“我的全部力量。瞧，在你的愿望下，我把我的力量像水一样倾注在大地上，而大地又像水一样从我身上吸走了它——它已经消失了，我再也无能为力了。”树木憔悴而枯萎地站着，所有的人都为她哭泣，但曼威说：“神的孩子们，不要哭泣，这是无法弥补的伤害，因为许多美好的事可能还没有完成，而美丽还没有消亡在大地上，也没有众神的所有建议都化为乌有”，但人们仍然悲伤地离开了那个地方，除了瓦娜，她紧紧抓住劳瑞林的树干哭了起来。</p>
<p class="TRSorigin">Now was the time of faintest hope and darkness most profound fallen on Valinor that was ever yet; and still did Vána weep, and she twined her golden hair about the bole of Laurelin and her tears dropped softly at its roots; and even as the dew of her gentle love touched that tree, behold, a sudden pale gleam was born in those dark places. Then gazed Vána in wonder, and even where her first tears fell a shoot sprang from Laurelin, and it budded, and the buds were all of gold, and there came light therefrom like a ray of sunlight beneath a cloud.</p>
<p class="TRStarget">现在是有史以来最微弱的希望和最深沉的黑暗降临在维林诺身上的时候了。瓦娜仍然在哭泣，她将金色的头发缠绕在劳瑞林的树干上，她的泪水轻轻地从它的根部滴落。就在她温柔的爱的露水触及那棵树时，看啊，那些黑暗的地方突然出现了苍白的光芒。然后惊奇地凝视着瓦娜，就在她的第一滴眼泪落下的地方，从劳瑞林身上长出了一个嫩芽，它发芽了，所有的嫩芽都是金色的，从那里透出光亮，就像云层下的一缕阳光。</p>
<p class="TRSorigin">Then sped Vána a little way out upon the plain, and she lifted up her sweet voice with all her power and it came trembling faintly to the gates of Valmar, and all the Valar heard. Then said Ómar:“’Tis the voice of Vána’s lamentation,”but Salmar said:“Nay, listen more, for rather is there joy in that sound,”and all that stood by hearkened, and the words they heard were <em>I·kal’ antúlien</em>, Light hath returned.</p>
<p class="TRStarget">然后，瓦娜在平原上开了一小段路，她用尽全力提高了她甜美的声音，声音微弱地颤抖着传到了维尔玛的大门，所有的维拉都听到了。欧玛接着说：“这是瓦娜的悲叹之声，”但萨尔玛说：“不，多听听，因为那声音里更有欢乐。”站在一旁的人都听了，他们听到的话是I·kal’ antúlien，光回来了。</p>
<p class="TRSorigin">Loud then was the murmur about the streets of Valmar, and folk sped thronging over the plain, and when they beheld Vána beneath the Tree and the new shoot of gold then suddenly did a song of very mighty praise and joy burst forth on every tongue; and Tulkas said:“Lo, mightier have the spells of Yavanna proved than her foretelling！”But Yavanna gazing upon Vána’s face said:“Alas, ’tis not so, for in this have my spells played but a lesser part, and more potent has the gentle love of Vána been and her falling tears a dew more healing and more tender than all the radiance of old: yet as for my foretelling, soon wilt thou see, O Tulkas, if thou dost but watch.”</p>
<p class="TRStarget">维尔玛街上的喧闹声响起，人们在平原上飞驰而过，当他们看到树下的瓦娜和新的金芽时，突然间，每一个人的舌头上都爆发出一首非常强烈的赞美和欢乐的歌曲。托卡斯说：“瞧，雅凡娜的咒语比她的预言更能证明！”但是雅凡娜凝视着瓦娜的脸说：“唉，事实并非如此，因为我的咒语在这方面发挥的作用很小，瓦娜温柔的爱更加有力，她落下的泪水比露水更治愈，更温柔所有古老的光辉：但至于我的预言，你很快就会看到，哦托卡斯，如果你只是注意的话。”</p>
<p class="TRSorigin">Then did all the folk gaze on Laurelin, and behold, those buds opened and put forth leaves, and these were of finest gold and of <a id="page185"></a>other kind to those of old, and even as they watched the branch bore golden blossom, and it was thronged with flowers. Now as swiftly as its blossoms opened full it seemed a gust of wind came suddenly and shook them from their slender stems, blowing them about the heads of those that watched like jets of fire, and folk thought there was evil in that; but many of the Eldar chased those shining petals far and wide and gathered them in baskets, yet save such as were of golden threads or of other metals these might not contain those ardent blooms and were all consumed and burnt, that the petals were lost again.</p>
<p class="TRStarget">然后所有的人都注视着劳瑞林，瞧，那些花蕾开了，长出了叶子，这些是最好的黄金，与古老的不同，当他们看着树枝开出金色的花朵时，花朵挤挤挨挨。现在，就像它的花朵开得那样快，好像一阵风突然袭来，把它们从纤细的茎上摇晃起来，把它们吹到那些像喷火一样注视着的人的头上，人们认为那是邪恶的。但是许多精灵族人追逐着那些闪闪发光的花瓣，把它们收集在篮子里，但除了金线或其他金属之外，它们可能没有那些炽热的花朵，都被消耗和燃烧，花瓣又丢失了.</p>
<p class="TRSorigin">One flower there was however greater than the others, more shining, and more richly golden, and it swayed to the winds but fell not; and it grew, and as it grew of its own radiant warmth it fructified. Then as its petals fell and were treasured a fruit there was of great beauty hanging from that bough of Laurelin, but the leaves of the bough grew sere and they shrivelled and shone no more. Even as they dropped to earth the fruit waxed wonderfully, for all the sap and radiance of the dying Tree were in it, and the juices of that fruit were like quivering flames of amber and of red and its pips like shining gold, but its rind was of a perfect lucency smooth as a glass whose nature is transfused with gold and therethrough the moving of its juices could be seen within like throbbing furnace-fires. So great became the light and richness of that growth and the weight of its fruitfulness that the bough bent thereunder, and it hung as a globe of fires before their eyes.</p>
<p class="TRStarget">然而，那里的一朵花比其他的更大，更闪亮，更金黄，它随风摇曳，但没有落下。它长大了，随着它自身散发出的温暖而成长，它就结出了果实。然后，当它的花瓣掉落并被珍藏起来时，劳瑞林的那根树枝上挂着非常美丽的果实，但是树枝的叶子变得枯萎了，它们枯萎了，不再发光了。就在它们掉到地上的时候，果实还是很漂亮，因为里面充满了垂死之树的汁液和光辉，果实的汁液就像琥珀色和红色的颤抖的火焰，它的果核像闪亮的金子，但它的果皮透明得像玻璃一样光滑，它的本质是注入了黄金，通过它可以看到它的汁液在里面流动，就像跳动的炉火一样。那棵树的光亮和丰盈，以及它硕果累累的重量，都变得如此之大，以至于树枝都弯到了树下，它就像一个火球一样悬在他们眼前。</p>
<p class="TRSorigin">Then said Yavanna to Aulë:“Bear thou up the branch, my lord, lest it snap and the fruit of wonder be dashed rudely to the ground; and the greatest ruth would that be, for know ye all that this is the last flame of life that Laurelin shall show.”But Aulë had stood by as one lost in sudden thought since first that fruit came to ripening, and he answered now saying:“Very long indeed did Varda and I seek through the desolate homes and gardens for materials of our craft. Now do I know that Ilúvatar has brought my desire into my hand.”Then calling to Tulkas to aid him he severed the stem of that fruit, and they that behold gasped and were astonied at his ruthlessness.</p>
<p class="TRStarget">然后雅凡娜对奥力说：“大人，你把树枝撑起来，以免它折断，奇迹的果实被粗暴地砸在地上；最大的真理就是，因为你们都知道，这是劳瑞林将展现的最后的生命之火。”但奥力站在一旁，从那颗果实开始成熟时突然陷入沉思，他现在回答说：“瓦尔妲和我确实很久以来就在荒凉的房屋和花园中寻找我们的工艺材料。现在我知道伊露维塔已经把我的欲望带到了我的手中。”然后他呼唤托卡斯帮助他，他切断了那个果实的茎，看到他的人倒吸一口凉气，对他的无情感到惊讶。</p>
<p class="TRSorigin">Loudly they murmured, and some cried:“Woe to him that ravishes anew our Tree,”and Vána was in great ire. Yet did none dare to draw nigh, for those twain Aulë and Tulkas might scarcely bear up even upon their godlike shoulders that great globe of flame and were tottering beneath it. Hearing their anger indeed Aulë stayed, saying:“Cease ye of little wisdom and have a patience,”but <a id="page186"></a>even with those words his foot went astray and he stumbled, and even Tulkas might not bear that fruit alone, so that it fell, and striking stony ground burst asunder. Straightway such a blinding radiance leapt forth as even the full bloom of Laurelin had not yielded of old, and the darkened eyes of the Vali were dazzled so that they fell back stunned; but a pillar of light rose from that place smiting the heavens that the stars paled above it and the face of Taniquetil went red afar off, and Aulë alone of all those there was unmoved by sorrow. Then said Aulë:“Of this can I make a ship of light—surpassing even the desire of Manwë,”and now Varda and many others, even Vána, understood his purpose and were glad. But they made a mighty corbel of twisted gold, and strewing it with ardent petals of its own bloom they laid therein the halves of the fruit of noon and uplifting it with many hands bore it away with much singing and great hope. Then coming to the courts of Aulë they set it down, and thereupon began the great smithying of the Sun; and this was the most cunning-marvellous of all the works of Aulë Talkamarda, whose works are legion. Of that perfect rind a vessel did he make, diaphanous and shining, yet of a tempered strength, for with spells of his own he overcame its brittleness, nor in any way was its subtle delicacy thereby diminished.</p>
<p class="TRStarget">他们大声地喃喃自语，有些人喊道：“重伤我们的树的人有祸了，”瓦娜怒不可遏。然而没有人敢靠近，因为奥力和塔卡斯这对孪生兄弟甚至连他们神一般的肩膀上都几乎无法承受那个巨大的火焰球体，并且在它下面摇摇欲坠。听到他们的愤怒，奥力果然停了下来，说：“你们不要再缺乏智慧了，要有耐心。”但即使说了这些话，他的脚也误入歧途，跌跌撞撞，即使是托卡斯也可能无法独自结出那个果实，以至于它跌倒了，惊人的石质地面炸裂。就连月桂树的盛开也未曾凋谢，顿时迸发出如此耀眼的光辉，而维拉漆黑的眼眸也被刺得目瞪口呆，目瞪口呆地往后退去。但是从那地方升起了一道光柱，照亮了天空，星星在它上面苍白，塔尼克提尔的脸在远处涨红了，只有奥力在所有的人中不为悲伤所动。然后奥力说：“我可以用它制造一艘光之船——甚至超过曼威的愿望。”现在瓦尔妲和其他许多人，甚至瓦娜，都明白了他的目的并很高兴。但是他们用扭曲的金子做了一个强大的牛腿，在上面撒上它自己盛开的炽热花瓣，他们把中午果实的一半放在里面，用许多手举起它，带着巨大的歌声和巨大的希望把它带走。然后他们来到奥力的宫廷，把它放下，然后开始了太阳的大锻造。这是奥力·塔卡玛达所有作品中最狡猾、最奇妙的一部，他的作品数不胜数。他用完美的外壳制成了一个容器，透明而闪亮，但具有经过调和的力量，因为他用自己的咒语克服了它的脆弱，无论如何也没有因此削弱它的微妙细腻。</p>
<p class="TRSorigin">Now the most ardent radiance poured therein neither spilled nor dimmed, nor did that vessel receive any injury therefrom, yet would it swim the airs more lightly than a bird; and Aulë was overjoyed, and he fashioned that vessel like a great ship broad of beam, laying one half of the rind within the other so that its strength might not be broken.</p>
<p class="TRStarget">现在倾注在其中的最炽热的光辉，既没有溢出，也没有变暗，也没有受到任何伤害，却比鸟儿更轻盈地在空中游弋；奥力欣喜若狂，他把那艘船塑造成一艘宽阔的大船，把一半的外皮放在另一半里，这样它的力量就不会被破坏。</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="TRSorigin">There follows an account of how Vána, repenting of her past murmurings, cut short her golden hair and gave it to the Gods, and from her hair they wove sails and ropes ‘more strong than any mariner hath seen, yet of the slenderness of gossamer’. The masts and spars of the ship were all of gold.</p>
<p class="TRStarget">下面讲述了瓦娜如何忏悔她过去的怨言，剪短她的金色头发并将其献给众神，他们用她的头发编织出‘比任何水手都见过的更坚固的帆和绳索，又如游丝般纤细’。船的桅杆和桅杆都是金的。</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="TRSorigin">Then that the Ship of the Heavens might be made ready unto the last, the unfading petals of the latest flower of Laurelin were gathered like a star at her prow, and tassels and streamers of glancing light were hung about her bulwarks, and a flash of lightning was caught in her mast to be a pennant; but all that vessel was filled to the brim with the blazing radiance of gold Kulullin and mingled therein drops of the juices of the fruit of noon, and these were very hot, and thereafter scarcely might the bosom of the Earth withhold her, and she leapt at her cords like a captive bird that listeth for the airs.</p>
<p class="TRStarget">然后，为了让天堂之船做好最后的准备，劳瑞林的最新一朵花的不消亡的花瓣像星星一样聚集在她的船头，流苏和闪烁的流光挂在她的舷墙周围，一道闪光闪电在她的桅杆上被夹住作为三角旗；但那整个容器都充满了金Kulullin的炽热光芒，并在其中混合着中午果实的汁液，这些汁液非常热，此后大地的怀抱几乎无法阻止她，她跳了起来在她的绳索上，就像一只在空中聆听的俘虏鸟。</p>
<p class="TRSorigin">Then did the Gods name that ship, and they called her Sári which <a id="page187"></a>is the Sun, but the Elves <span id="l_25"><a href="#l25">Ûr which is fire</a></span>;<span id="ch8_en12"><a href="#ch8en12"><sup>12</sup></a></span> but many other names does she bear in legend and in poesy. The Lamp of Vána is she named among the Gods in memory of Vána’s tears and her sweet tresses that she gave; and the Gnomes call her <span id="p_187a">Galmir the goldgleamer</span><span id="ch8_en13"><a href="#ch8en13"><sup>13</sup></a></span> and Glorvent the ship of gold, and <span id="p_187aa">Bráglorin the blazing vessel</span>, and many a name beside; and her names among Men no man has counted them.</p>
<p class="TRStarget">然后神给那艘船起了名字，他们称她为 Sári，即太阳，而精灵 Ûr，即火；<a href="#ch8en12">¹²</a>但她在传说和诗歌中还有许多其他名字。瓦娜之灯是她在众神中的名字，以纪念瓦娜的眼泪和她给予的甜美长发；诺姆称她为金闪闪的和荣耀黄金之船Galmir<a href="#ch8en13">¹³</a>，以及燃烧的船Bráglorin，以及许多其他的名字；她的名字在人类中无人数过。</p>
<p class="TRSorigin">Behold now it is to be told how while that galleon was a-building others nigh to where the Two Trees once grew fashioned a great bason and folk laboured mightily at it. Its floor they made of gold and its walls of polished bronze, and an arcade of golden pillars topped with fires engirdled it, save only on the East; but Yavanna set a great and nameless spell around it, so that therein was poured the most of the waters of the fruit of noon and it became a bath of fire. Indeed is it not called Tanyasalpë, the bowl of fire, even Faskalanúmen, the Bath of the Setting Sun, for here when Urwendi after returned from the East and the first sunset came on Valinor the ship was drawn down and its radiance refreshed against new voyagings on the morrow while the Moon held High Heaven.</p>
<p class="TRStarget">看吧，现在要说的是，当那艘大帆船建造在双圣树曾经生长的地方附近的其他建筑时，它是如何塑造一个巨大的盆地的，人们如何在它上面辛勤劳作。他们用金做地板，用抛光的青铜做墙壁，除了东方以外，还有一座顶着火的金色柱子拱廊环绕着它。但是雅凡娜在它周围设置了一个巨大而无名的咒语，因此将中午果实的大部分水倒入其中，它变成了火浴。确实，它不被称为 Tanyasalpë，火碗，甚至 Faskalanúmen，落日浴场，因为当阿瑞恩从东方回来后，维林诺的第一道日落来到这里时，船被拉下来，它的光辉在次日新的航行中焕然一新，当月亮执掌高天。</p>
<p class="TRSorigin">Now the making of this place of fire is more wondrous than seems, for so subtle were those radiances that set in the air they spilled not nor sank, nay rather they rose and floated away far above Vilna, being of the utmost buoyancy and lightness; yet now did nought escape from Faskalan which burnt amid the plain, and light came to Valinor therefrom, yet by reason of the deepness of the bason it fared not far abroad and the ring of shadows stood close in.</p>
<p class="TRStarget">现在这个火场的形成比看起来更奇妙，因为那些在空中落下的光芒是如此微妙，它们既没有溢出也没有下沉，更确切地说，它们升起并漂浮在Vilna上空，具有最大的浮力和轻盈。然而现在没有任何东西能从平原中燃烧的Faskalan逃脱，光线从那里照到维林诺，但由于盆地很深，它飞到不远的地方，而阴影环就在附近。</p>
<p class="TRSorigin">Then said Manwë, looking upon the glory of that ship as it strained to be away:“Who shall steer us this boat and guide its course above the realms of Earth, for even the holy bodies of the Valar, meseems, may not for long endure to bathe in this great light.”</p>
<p class="TRStarget">然后曼威看着那艘快要离开的船的荣耀说道：“谁能驾驭这艘船，引导它飞越大地，因为即使是维拉的圣体，似乎也无法长久地沐浴在这伟大的光芒中。”</p>
<p class="TRSorigin">But a great thought came into the heart of Urwendi, and she said that she was not adread, and begged leave to become the mistress of the Sun and to make herself ready for that office as Ilúvatar set it in her heart to do. Then did she bid a many of her maidens follow her, even of those who had aforetime watered the roots of Laurelin with light, and casting aside their raiment they went down into that pool Faskalan as bathers into the sea, and its golden foams went over their bodies, and the Gods saw them not and were afraid. But after a while they came again to the brazen shores and were not as before, for their bodies were grown lucent and shone as with an ardour within, and light flashed from their limbs as they moved, nor might any raiment endure to cover their glorious bodies any more. Like <a id="page188"></a>air were they, and they trod as lightly as does sunlight on the earth, and saying no word they climbed upon the ship, and that vessel heaved against its great cords and all the folk of Valinor might scarce restrain it.</p>
<p class="TRStarget">但一个伟大的想法出现在阿瑞恩的心中，她说她并不害怕，并请求离开成为太阳的执掌者，并按照伊露维塔的心意为那个职位做好准备。然后她命令她的许多少女跟随她，甚至那些以前用光浇灌劳瑞林树根的人，她们脱下衣服，像沐浴在大海中一样进入Faskalan池，它的金色泡沫溢出他们的身体，众神没有看到他们，也很害怕。但过了一会儿，他们又回到了铜色的海岸，不再像以前那样了，因为他们的身体变得通透，闪烁着炽热的光芒，四肢闪烁着光芒，任何衣服都无法遮盖他们的光彩。身体了。他们像空气一样轻快地踩在地上，就像阳光照在大地上一样，一言不发地爬上了船，那艘船在它的大绳索上摇晃着，维林诺的所有居民都几乎无法抑制它。</p>
<p class="TRSorigin">Now at last by Manwë’s command do they climb the long slopes of Taniquetil and draw <span id="l_36"><a href="#l36">i·Kalaventë the Ship of Light</a></span> along with them, nor is that any great task; and now do they stand on the wide space before great Manwë’s doors, and the ship is on the western slope of the mountain trembling and tugging at its bonds, and already so great is its glory become that sunbeams pour out over the shoulders of Taniquetil and a new light is in the sky, and the waters of the Shadowy Seas beyond are touched with such fire as they never yet had seen. In that hour ’tis said that all creatures that wandered in the world stood still and wondered, even as Manwë going spake to Urwendi and said: “Go now, most wondrous maiden washed in fire, and steer the ship of divine light above the world, that joy may search out its narrowest crannies and all the things that sleep within its bosom may awake”<span id="ch8_en14"><a href="#ch8en14"><sup>14</sup></a></span> but Urwendi answered not, looking only eagerly to the East, and Manwë bade cast the ropes that held her, and straightway the Ship of the Morning arose above Taniquetil and the bosom of the air received it.</p>
<p class="TRStarget">现在终于在曼威的指挥下，他们爬上了塔尼克提尔的长坡，并拉上了光之船 i·Kalaventë，这也不是什么伟大的任务；现在他们站在伟大的曼威门前的广阔空间上，船在山的西坡上颤抖着拉着它的绳索，它的荣耀已经如此伟大，以至于阳光从塔尼克提尔的肩膀上倾泻而下，天空中出现了新的光芒，远处的阴影之海的水域被他们从未见过的火焰所触动。据说在那一刻，所有在世界上游荡的生物都站着不动，甚至在曼威对阿瑞恩说：“现在去吧，最奇妙的少女在火中洗涤，驾驶神圣之光的船在世界上空，让喜悦可以探寻它最狭窄的缝隙，让所有沉睡在它怀里的东西都可以醒来”<a href="#ch8en14">¹⁴</a>但阿瑞恩没有回答，只是热切地望着东方，曼威吩咐解开束缚她的绳索，晨曦之船立即升到塔尼克提尔上空，空气的怀抱接受了它。</p>
<p class="TRSorigin">Ever as it rose it burned the brighter and the purer till all Valinor was filled with radiance, and the vales of Erúmáni and the Shadowy Seas were bathed in light, and sunshine was spilled on the dark plain of Arvalin, save only where Ungweliantë’s clinging webs and darkest fumes still lay too thick for any radiance to filter through.</p>
<p class="TRStarget">随着它的升起，它燃烧得越来越明亮，越来越纯净，直到整个维林诺都充满了光辉，Erúmáni的山谷和阴暗的海洋沐浴在阳光中，阳光洒在阿瓦林的黑暗平原上，除了乌格威立安提紧紧缠住的网最黑暗的烟雾仍然太厚，任何光芒都无法过滤。</p>
<p class="TRSorigin">Then all looking up saw that heaven was blue, and very bright and beautiful, but the stars fled as that great dawn came upon the world; and a gentle wind blew from the cold lands to meet the vessel and filled its gleaming sails, and white vapours mounted from off the misty seas below toward her, that her prow seemed to cleave a white and airy foam. Yet did she waver not, for the Mánir that fared about her drew her by golden cords, and higher and higher the Sun’s great galleon arose, until even to the sight of Manwë it was but a disc of fire wreathed in veils of splendour that slowly and majestically wandered from the West.</p>
<p class="TRStarget">然后所有的人都抬头看到天空是蓝色的，非常明亮和美丽，但是当那伟大的黎明降临世界时，星星都消失了。一阵温和的风从寒冷的陆地吹来，迎面而来，吹满了它闪闪发光的帆，白色的蒸汽从下面迷雾笼罩的海面升起，朝她飞来，她的船头似乎裂开了一层白色的空气泡沫。然而，她并没有动摇，因为在她周围航行的Mánir用金色的绳索牵引着她，太阳的大帆船升得越来越高，直到曼威的视线中，它只是一个被光辉面纱包裹的火轮，慢慢地并威风凛凛地从西方飘来。</p>
<p class="TRSorigin">Now ever as it drew further on its way so grew the light in Valinor more mellow, and the shadows of the houses of the Gods grew long, slanting away towards the waters of the Outer Seas, but Taniquetil threw a great westering shadow that waxed ever longer and deeper, and it was afternoon in Valinor.’</p>
<p class="TRStarget">现在，随着它越走越远，维林诺的光线也变得越来越柔和，众神房屋的阴影越来越长，向外海的水域倾斜，但塔尼魁提尔投下了一个巨大的西行阴影，而且越来越大更长更深，现在是维林诺的下午。</p>
<p class="TRSorigin">Then said Gilfanon laughing: ‘Nay, but, good sir, you lengthen <a id="page189"></a>the tale mightily, for methinks you love to dwell upon the works and deeds of the great Gods, but an you set not a measure to your words our stranger here will live not to hear of those things that happened in the world when at length the Gods gave to it the light they so long had withholden—and such tales, methinks, were a variety pleasing to hear.’</p>
<p class="TRStarget">然后吉尔法农笑着说：“不，但是，好先生，你把这个故事大大地延长了，因为我认为你喜欢详述伟大神的作品和行为，但是你没有衡量你的话，我们的陌生人会在这里生活不知道世界上发生的那些事情，当众神最终将他们长久以来一直隐瞒的亮光赐给它时——我认为，这样的故事很有趣。”</p>
<p class="TRSorigin">But Eriol had of a sooth been listening very eagerly to the sweet voice of Lindo, and he said: ‘But a little while agone, a day perchance the Eldar would esteem it, did I come hither, yet no longer do I love the name of stranger, neither will Lindo ever lengthen the tale beyond my liking, whatsoever he tells, but behold this history is all to my heart.’</p>
<p class="TRStarget">但埃利欧尔一直非常热切地倾听林多甜美的声音，他说：“但不久前，精灵族可能会尊重它，我是否来到这里，但我不再喜欢这个名字陌生人，无论他说什么，林多都不会把这个故事延长到我不喜欢的程度，但是看，这段历史是我心中的全部。”</p>
<p class="TRSorigin">But Lindo said: ‘Nay, nay, I have indeed more to tell; yet, O Eriol, the things that <a href="#l30">Gilfanon</a> hath upon his lips are well worth the hearing—indeed never have I nor any here heard a full count of these matters. As soon therefore as may be will I wind up my tale and make an end, but three nights hence let us have another tale-telling, and it shall be one of greater ceremony, and musics there shall be, and all the children of the House of Lost Play shall here be gathered together at his feet to hear Gilfanon relate the travail of the Noldoli and the coming of Mankind.’</p>
<p class="TRStarget">但林多说：“不，不，我确实还有更多要说的；然而，埃利欧尔，吉尔法农嘴上说的那些话还是很值得一听的——事实上，我和这里的任何人从来没有听过这些事情的全部内容。因此，我将尽快结束我的故事并结束，但三天后让我们再讲一个故事，这将是一个更大的仪式，音乐将有，所有嬉乐不再的小屋的孩子将聚集在他的脚下，听吉尔法农讲述诺多族的艰辛和人类的到来。</p>
<p class="TRSorigin">Now these words mightily pleased Gilfanon and Eriol, and many beside were glad, but now doth Lindo proceed:</p>
<p class="TRStarget">现在这些话使吉尔法农和埃利欧尔非常高兴，旁边的许多人都很高兴，但现在林多继续说：</p>
<p class="TRSorigin">‘Know then that to such vast heights did the Sunship climb, and climbing blazed ever hotter and brighter, that ere long its glory was wider than ever the Gods conceived of when that vessel was still harboured in their midst. Everywhere did its great light pierce and all the vales and darkling woods, the bleak slopes and rocky streams, lay dazzled by it, and the Gods were amazed. Great was the magic and wonder of the Sun in those days of bright Urwendi, yet not so tender and so delicately fair as had the sweet Tree Laurelin once been; and thus whisper of new discontent awoke in Valinor, and words ran among the children of the Gods, for Mandos and Fui were wroth, saying that Aulë and Varda would for ever be meddling with the due order of the world, making it a place where no quiet or peaceful shadow could remain; but Lórien sat and wept in a grove of trees beneath the shade of Taniquetil and looked upon his gardens stretching beneath, still disordered by the great hunt of the Gods, for he had not had the heart for their mending. There the nightingales were silent for the heat danced above the trees, and his poppies were withered, and his evening flowers drooped and gave no scent; and Silmo stood sadly by Telimpë that gleamed wanly as still waters rather than the shining dew of Silpion, so overmastering was the <a id="page190"></a>great light of day. Then Lórien arose and said to Manwë:“Call back your glittering ship, O Lord of the Heavens, for the eyes of us ache by reason of its flaming, and beauty and soft sleep is driven far away. Rather the darkness and our memories than this, for this is not the old loveliness of Laurelin, and Silpion is no more.”Nor were any of the Gods utterly content, knowing in their hearts that <a href="#l42">they had done a greater thing</a> than they at first knew, and never again would Valinor see such ages as had passed; and Vána said that Kulullin’s fount was dulled and her garden wilted in the heat, and her roses lost their hues and fragrance, for the Sun then sailed nearer to the Earth than it now does.</p>
<p class="TRStarget">“那时要知道，太阳船爬到了如此巨大的高度，而且攀登的火焰越来越热，越来越亮，不久它的荣耀就比众神想象的更广阔，当时这艘船还藏在他们中间。它的大光无处不在，所有的山谷和黑暗的树林，荒凉的山坡和岩石的溪流都被它刺得眼花缭乱，众神都为之惊叹。在阳光明媚的阿瑞恩时代，太阳的魔力和奇迹是伟大的，但不像曾经甜美的月桂树那样温柔和精致。因此，维林诺传来新的不满情绪，众神之子之间传来消息，因为曼督斯和芙伊很生气，说奥力和瓦尔妲将永远干涉世界的正当秩序，使它成为一个地方没有安静或平静的阴影可以留下；但是罗瑞恩坐在塔尼克提尔树荫下的小树林里哭泣，看着他在下面延伸的花园，仍然被众神的大狩猎弄得乱七八糟，因为他没有心去修补。那里的夜莺沉默不语，因为热气在树上翩翩起舞，他的罂粟枯萎了，他的黄昏花朵垂落，没有香味。熙尔牟悲哀地站在泰林佩身边，它像静止的水一样微弱地闪烁，而不是熙尔皮安的闪亮露水，如此霸道的是伟大的白昼。然后罗瑞恩站起身来对曼威说：“天堂之主啊，把你闪闪发光的船叫回来，因为我们的眼睛因为它的燃烧而疼痛，美丽和柔软的睡眠被驱离了很远的地方。与其说是黑暗，不如说是我们的记忆，因为这不再是劳瑞林的旧时可爱，而熙尔皮安也不复存在了。”也没有任何一位神完全满足，因为他们心里知道他们做了比他们最初所知道的更伟大的事情，而且维林诺再也不会看到这样的时代过去了。瓦娜说，Kulullin的泉水变淡了，她的花园在炎热中枯萎了，她的玫瑰失去了色彩和芬芳，因为那时太阳比现在更接近大地。</p>
<p class="TRSorigin">Then Manwë chid them for their fickleness and discontent, but they were not appeased; and suddenly spake Ulmo, coming from outer Vai:“Lord Manwë, neither are their counsels nor thine to be despised. Have ye then not yet understood, O Valar, wherein lay much of the great beauty of the Trees of old?—In change, and in slow alternation of fair things, the passing blending sweetly with that which was to come.”</p>
<p class="TRStarget">然后曼威责备他们反复无常和不满，但他们没有安抚。突然，乌欧牟从外Vai说话道：“曼威大人，他们的建议和你的建议都不容轻视。哦，维拉，你们难道还不明白，古老的树木的许多美丽之处都在其中吗？——美丽的事物在变化和缓慢的交替中，逝去的事物与即将到来的事物甜蜜地融合在一起。”</p>
<p class="TRSorigin">But Lórien said suddenly:“O Valatúru, the Lord of Vai speaketh words wiser than ever before, and they fill me with a great longing,”and he left them thereupon and went out upon the plain, and it was then three daytimes, which is the length of three blossomings of Laurelin of old, since the Ship of Morning was unmoored. Then for four daytimes more sate Lórien beside the stock of Silpion and the shadows gathered shyly round him, for the Sun was far to the East, beating about the heavens where it listed, since Manwë had not as yet ruled its course and Urwendi was bidden fare as seemed good to her. Yet even so Lórien is not appeased, not though the darkness of the mountains creep across the plain, and a mist bloweth in from off the sea and a vague and flitting twilight gathers once more in Valinor, but long he sits pondering why the spells of Yavanna wrought only upon Laurelin.</p>
<p class="TRStarget">但是罗瑞恩突然说：“哦，维拉之主，Vai之主说话比以往任何时候都聪明，它们让我充满了强烈的渴望，”他说完就离开了他们，走到了平原上，然后是三天，是古老的月桂树花的三朵花的长度，因为早晨的船已经停泊了。然后，又过了四天，罗瑞恩坐在罗瑞恩的储备旁边，阴影害羞地聚集在他周围，因为太阳在东方很远，在它所在的天空中跳动，因为曼威还没有设置它的路线，阿瑞恩被邀请的命令对她来说似乎不错。然而即便如此，罗瑞恩并没有得到安抚，尽管山脉的黑暗蔓延过平原，一股薄雾从海上吹来，模糊而飘忽的暮光再次聚集在维林诺，但他长时间坐着思考为什么雅凡娜只在劳瑞林身上工作。</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="TRSorigin">Then Lórien sang to Silpion, saying that the Valar were lost ‘in a wilderness of gold and heat, or else in shadows full of death and unkindly glooms,’ and he touched the wound in the bole of the Tree.</p>
<p class="TRStarget">然后罗瑞恩向熙尔皮安唱歌，说维拉迷失在“金色和炎热的荒野中，或者在充满死亡和阴暗的阴影中”，他抚摸着树干上的伤口。</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="TRSorigin">Lo, even as he touched that cruel hurt, a light glowed faintly there as if radiant sap still stirred within, but a low branch above Lórien’s bowed head burgeoned suddenly, and leaves of a very dark green, long and oval, budded and unfolded upon it, yet was all the Tree beside bare and dead and has ever been so since. Now it was at <a id="page191"></a>that time seven times seven days since the fruit of noon was born upon Laurelin, and many of the Eldar and of the sprites and of the Gods were drawn nigh, listening to Lórien’s song; but he heeded them not, gazing upon the Tree.</p>
<p class="TRStarget">瞧，就在他触碰到那残酷的伤痛的时候，那里隐隐约约地闪着光，仿佛里面还在搅动着光芒四射的树液，但罗瑞恩低垂的头顶上的一根低矮的树枝突然长了出来，一片深绿色的长椭圆形的叶子在上面发芽展开。它，但除了树之外，所有的树都光秃秃的，死了，从那以后就一直如此。从中午的果实在劳瑞林诞生后，已经是七七天了，许多精灵族、精灵和众神都被拉近，聆听罗瑞恩的歌声；但他没有理会他们，凝视着那棵树。</p>
<p class="TRSorigin">Lo, its new leaves were crusted with a silver moisture, and their undersides were white and set with pale gleaming filaments. Buds there were of flowers also upon the bough, and they opened, but a dark mist of the sea gathered about the tree, and the air grew bitterly cold as it never before had been in Valinor, and those blossoms faded and fell and none heeded them. One only was there at the branch’s end that opening shone of its own light and no mist or cold harmed it, but indeed waxing it seemed to suck the very vapours and transform them subtly to the silver substance of its body; and it grew to be a very pale and wondrous glistering flower, nor did even the purest snow upon Taniquetil gleaming in the light of Silpion out-rival it, and its heart was of white flame and it throbbed, waxing and waning marvellously. Then said Lórien for the joy of his heart:“Behold the Rose of Silpion”, and that rose grew till the fruit of Laurelin had been but little greater, and ten thousand crystal petals were in that flower, and it was drenched in a fragrant dew like honey and this dew was light. Now Lórien would suffer none to draw near, and this will he rue for ever: for the branch upon which the Rose hung yielded all its sap and withered, nor even yet would he suffer that blossom to be plucked gently down, being enamoured of its loveliness and lusting to see it grow mightier than the fruit of noon, more glorious than the Sun.</p>
<p class="TRStarget">瞧，它的新叶结上了一层银色的湿气，它们的底面是白色的，上面布满了微光闪闪的细丝。树枝上也有花蕾，它们开了，但海的黑雾聚集在树周围，空气变得前所未有的寒冷，维林诺从未有过，那些花朵凋谢了，无人理会他们。只有一个在树枝的末端，开口发出自己的光芒，没有雾气或寒冷伤害它，但实际上发光似乎吸收了水汽，并将它们巧妙地转化为它身体的银色物质。它变成了一朵非常苍白而奇妙的闪闪发光的花，即使是塔尼魁提尔上最纯净的雪，在熙尔皮安的光芒下闪闪发光，也比不上它，它的心脏是白色的火焰，它跳动着，奇妙地起伏着。罗瑞恩心里高兴地说：“看熙尔皮安的玫瑰”，那朵玫瑰一直长到月桂树的果实只剩下一点点大了，那朵花里有一万片水晶花瓣，浸透着芬芳。露水像蜂蜜，这露水很轻。现在罗瑞恩不愿让任何人靠近，他将永远后悔：因为挂在玫瑰上的枝条已经枯萎了，甚至他也不愿让那朵花被轻轻摘下，因为他沉迷于它的花香。可爱和渴望看到它比正午的果实更强大，比太阳更辉煌。</p>
<p class="TRSorigin">Then snapped the withered bough and the Rose of Silpion fell, and some of its dewy light was roughly shaken from it, and here and there a petal was crushed and tarnished, and Lórien cried aloud and sought to lift it gently up, but it was too great. Therefore did the Gods let send to Aulë’s halls, for there was a great silver charger, like to a table of the giants, and they set the latest bloom of Silpion upon it, and despite its hurts its glory and fragrance and pale magic were very great indeed.</p>
<p class="TRStarget">然后折断了枯枝，熙尔皮安玫瑰落了下来，它的一些露珠的光芒被粗暴地从它上面摇晃了出来，到处有一片花瓣被压碎和失去光泽，罗瑞恩大声喊叫着想轻轻地把它举起来，但它是太棒了。因此众神派人前往奥力的殿堂，因为那里有一个巨大的银色战马，就像一张巨人的桌子一样，他们在上面放上最新的西尔皮昂花，尽管它受到伤害，但它的荣耀、芬芳和苍白的魔法非常确实很棒。</p>
<p class="TRSorigin">Now when Lórien had mastered his grief and ruth he spake the counsel that Ulmo’s words had called to his heart: that the Gods build another vessel to match the galleon of the Sun,“and it shall be made from the Rose of Silpion,”said he,“and in memory of the waxing and waning of these Trees for twelve hours shall the Sunship sail the heavens and leave Valinor, and for twelve shall Silpion’s pale bark mount the skies, and there shall be rest for tired eyes and weary hearts.”</p>
<p class="TRStarget">现在，当罗瑞恩控制住了他的悲伤和露丝之后，他说出了乌欧牟的话唤起他的心声的忠告：众神建造了另一艘与太阳大帆船相匹配的船只，“它将由熙尔皮安的玫瑰制成，”说他说：“为了纪念这些树木的消长十二小时，太阳船将在天空中航行并离开维林诺，十二小时内，熙尔皮安苍白的树皮将登上天空，疲惫的眼睛和疲惫的心将得到休息。”</p>
<a id="page192"></a>
<p class="TRSorigin">This then was the manner of the shaping of the Moon, for Aulë would not dismember the loveliness of <span id="l_28"><a href="#l28">the Rose of Silver</a></span>, and he called rather to him certain of those Eldar of his household who were of the Noldoli of old<span id="ch8_en15"><a href="#ch8en15"><sup>15</sup></a></span> and had consorted with the jewel-makers. Now these revealed to him much store of crystals and delicate glasses that <span id="p_192g">Fëanor and his sons</span><span id="ch8_en16"><a href="#ch8en16"><sup>16</sup></a></span> had laid up in secret places in Sirnúmen, and with the aid of those Elves and of Varda of the stars, who gave even of the light of those frail boats of hers to give limpid clearness to their fashioning, he brought to being a substance thin as a petal of a rose, clear as the most transparent elfin glass, and very smooth, yet might Aulë of his skill bend it and fashion it, and naming it he called it <em>vírin</em>. Of <em>vírin</em> now he built a marvellous vessel, and often have men spoken of the Ship of the Moon, yet is it scarce like to any bark that sailed or sea or air. Rather was it like an island of pure glass, albeit not very great, and tiny lakes there were bordered with snowy flowers that shone, for the water of those pools that gave them sap was the radiance of Telimpë. Midmost of that shimmering isle was wrought a cup of that crystalline stuff that Aulë made and therein the magic Rose was set, and the glassy body of the vessel sparkled wonderfully as it gleamed therein. Rods there were and perchance they were of ice, and they rose upon it like aëry masts, and sails were caught to them by slender threads, and <span id="p_192">Uinen</span> wove them of white mists and foam, and some were sprent with glinting scales of silver fish, some threaded with tiniest stars like points of light—sparks caught in snow when Nielluin was shining.</p>
<p class="TRStarget">这就是塑造月亮的方式，因为奥力不会肢解白银玫瑰的可爱，他宁愿向他召唤他家里的某些埃尔达，他们是古代诺多族的成员<a href="#ch8en15"><sup>15</sup></a>并与珠宝制造商合作。现在，这些向他展示了费艾诺和他的儿子们收藏的大量水晶和精致的眼镜。<a href="#ch8en16"><sup>16</sup></a>他曾在Sirnúmen的秘密地方安顿下来，在那些精灵和星辰的瓦尔妲的帮助下，他们甚至用她那些脆弱的小船的光线来为它们的造型提供清晰的清晰度，他把自己变成了一个薄薄的实体就像一朵玫瑰的花瓣，像最透明的精灵玻璃一样清澈，非常光滑，但奥力可能会用他的技巧弯曲它并塑造它，并命名它为vírin。现在他建造了一艘神奇的船，经常有人谈论月球之船，但它不像任何可以航行或海上或空中的树皮。它更像是一座纯玻璃岛，虽然不是很大，那里的小湖边上点缀着闪闪发光的雪花，因为那些给它们带来汁液的水池里的水是泰林佩的光辉。那个闪闪发光的小岛的中央是用奥力制造的水晶材料制成的杯子，其中镶嵌着神奇的玫瑰，容器玻璃般的身体在其中闪闪发光时闪烁着奇妙的光芒。那里有杆子，可能是冰的，它们像一根桅杆一样升在上面，帆被细细的线抓住，乌妮用白雾和泡沫编织它们，有些上面布满精灵宝钻的闪闪发光的鳞片，有些像光点一样点缀着最微小的星星——当尼鲁因发光时，火花被雪覆盖了。</p>
<p class="TRSorigin">Thus was the Ship of the Moon, the crystal island of the Rose, and the Gods named it Rána, the Moon, but the fairies Sil, the Rose,<span id="ch8_en17"><a href="#ch8en17"><sup>17</sup></a></span> and many a sweet name beside. Ilsaluntë or the silver shallop has it been called, and thereto <span id="p_192a">the Gnomes have called it Minethlos</span> or the argent isle and Crithosceleg the disc of glass.</p>
<p class="TRStarget">这就是月亮之船，玫瑰的水晶岛，众神将它称为拉娜，月亮，但仙灵称其Sil，玫瑰，<a href="#ch8en17"><sup>17</sup></a>还有许多甜美的名字。它被称为 Ilsaluntë 或银色小鱼，而诺姆将其称为 Minethlos 或银色小岛，而 Crithosceleg 则称为玻璃圆盘。</p>
<p class="TRSorigin">Now Silmo begged to sail upon the oceans of the firmament therein, but he might not, for neither was he of the children of the air <span id="p_192v"><a href="#p192v">nor might he find a way to cleanse his being</a></span> of its earthwardness as had <span id="l29"><a href="#l_29">Urwendi</a></span><span id="ch8_en18"><a href="#ch8en18"><sup>18</sup></a></span> done, and little would it have availed to enter Faskalan had he dared essay it, for then would Rána have shrivelled before him. Manwë bade therefore Ilinsor, a spirit of the Súruli who loved the snows and the starlight and aided Varda in many of her works, to pilot this strange-gleaming boat, and with him went many another spirit of the air arrayed in robes of silver and white, or else of palest gold; but an aged Elf with hoary locks stepped upon the Moon unseen and hid him in the Rose, and there dwells he ever since and tends that flower, and a little white turret has he <a id="page193"></a>builded on the Moon where often he climbs and watches the heavens, or the world beneath, and that is Uolë Kúvion who sleepeth never. Some indeed have named him the Man in the Moon, but Ilinsor is it rather who hunts the stars.</p>
<p class="TRStarget">现在熙尔牟恳求在天空的海洋中航行，但他可能不会，因为他既不是天空之子，也无法像阿瑞恩那样找到一种方法来净化他的整个身体<a href="#ch8en18"><sup>18</sup></a>，如果他敢于这么做，进入Faskalan也无济于事，因为那样拉娜就会在他面前萎缩。曼威因此吩咐伊林索尔，一个热爱雪和星光并在瓦尔妲的许多工作中帮助过她的Súruli的灵魂，驾驶这艘奇怪的闪闪发光的船，和他一起去的还有许多穿​​着银色长袍的空中灵魂，白色，或者浅金色；但是一个白发苍苍的年长精灵在看不见的地方踏上月球并将他藏在玫瑰中，从那时起他就住在那里并照料那朵花，他在月球上建造了一座白色的小塔楼，他经常爬上去仰望天空，或地下世界，那就是永不眠的UolëKúvion。有些人确实将他称为月球上的人，但伊林索尔是猎杀星星的人。</p>
<p class="TRSorigin">Now is to tell how the plan that Lórien devised was changed, for the white radiance of Silpion is by no means so buoyant and ethereal as is the flame of Laurelin, nor <em>virin</em> so little weighty as the rind of the bright fruit of noon; and when the Gods laded the white ship with light and would launch it upon the heavens, behold, it would not rise above their heads. Moreover, behold, that living Rose continued to give forth a honey as of light that distills upon the isle of glass, and a dew of moonbeams glistens there, yet rather does this weigh the vessel than buoy it as did the increase of <a href="#p193v">the Sunship’s flames</a>. So is it that Ilinsor must return at times, and that overflowing radiance of the Rose is stored in Valinor against dark days—and it is to tell that such days come ever and anon, for then the white flower of the isle wanes and scarcely shines, and then must it be refreshed and watered with its silver dew, much as Silpion was wont of old to be.</p>
<p class="TRStarget">现在要讲述罗瑞恩设计的计划是如何改变的，因为熙尔皮安的白色光芒绝不像劳瑞林的火焰那样轻盈飘逸，也不像正午明亮果实的果皮那样轻巧；当众神为这艘白色的船装上光辉并将其发射到天上时，看啊，它并没有从他们的头顶升起。此外，看哪，那活生生的玫瑰继续散发出蜂蜜般的光芒，在玻璃岛上蒸馏，月光的露水在那里闪闪发光，但这与其说是给容器增加了重量，不如说是增加了太阳船的火焰。.是不是伊林索有时必须回来，玫瑰的溢出光辉储存在维林诺以抵御黑暗的日子——这说明这样的日子永远不会到来，因为那时岛上的白色花朵会凋谢，几乎不会发光，然后它必须用它的银色露水刷新和浇灌，就像熙尔皮安过去不习惯的那样。</p>
<p class="TRSorigin">Hence was it that a pool was builded hard by the dark southern wall of Valmar, and of silver and white marbles were its walls, but dark yews shut it in, being planted in a maze most intricate about it. There Lórien hoarded the pale dewy light of that fair Rose, and he named it the Lake Irtinsa.</p>
<p class="TRStarget">因此，维尔玛的南面黑暗墙壁硬建了一个水池，它的墙壁是银色和白色的大理石，但黑色的紫杉将它封闭在里面，种植在一个最复杂的迷宫中。罗瑞恩在那里收藏了那朵美丽玫瑰的淡露水光，并将其称为Irtinsa湖。</p>
<p class="TRSorigin">So comes it that for fourteen nights men may see Rána’s bark float upon the airs, and for other fourteen the heavens know it not; while even on those fair nights when Rána fares abroad it showeth not ever the same aspect as doth Sári the glorious, for whereas that bright galleon voyageth even above Ilwë and beyond the stars and cleaveth a dazzling way blinding the heavens, highest of all things recking little of winds or motions of the airs, yet Ilinsor’s bark is heavier and less filled with magic and with power, and fareth never above the skies but saileth in the lower folds of Ilwë threading a white swathe among the stars. For this reason the high winds trouble it at times, tugging at its misty shrouds; and often are these torn and scattered, and the Gods renew them. At times too are the petals of the Rose ruffled, and its white flames blown hither and thither like a silver candle guttering in the wind. Then doth Rána heave and toss about the air, as often you may see him, and mark the slender curve of his bright keel, his prow now dipping, now his stern; and whiles again he sails serenely to the West, and up through the pure lucency of his frame the wide Rose of Silpion is seen, and some say the aged form of Uolë Kúvion beside.</p>
<p class="TRStarget">因此，人们可以在十四个晚上看到拉娜的树皮漂浮在空中，而对于其他十四个夜晚，天堂却不知道。即使在那些美丽的夜晚，当拉娜出国旅行时，它也永远不会显示出与 Sári 荣耀相同的面貌，因为那艘明亮的大帆船甚至在伊尔威上空航行，越过群星，劈开一条耀眼的道路，使天空目眩，在所有事物中最高几乎没有风或空气的运动，但伊林索的树皮更重，更少充满魔法和力量，而且从未飞过天空，而是在伊尔威较低的褶皱中航行，在群星中穿出一条白色的长带。正因如此，大风有时会给它带来困扰，拉扯它朦胧的裹尸布；这些经常被撕裂和分散，众神更新它们。玫瑰的花瓣有时也会皱起，白色的火焰四处飘扬，就像一根在风中飘荡的银色蜡烛。然后，拉纳像你经常看到的那样，在空中举起和翻腾，并标记出他明亮的龙骨的纤细曲线，他的船头现在下垂，现在他的船尾；一会儿，他又平静地航行到西方，透过他纯粹透明的身躯，可以看到宽阔的罗瑞恩玫瑰，有人说旁边是乌拉·库维恩的老年形象。</p>
<a id="page194"></a>
<p class="TRSorigin">Then indeed is the Ship of the Moon very fair to look upon, and the Earth is filled with slender lights and deep quick-moving shadows, and radiant dreams go with cool wings about the world, but Lórien has ruth amid his gladness, because his flower bears yet, and will for ever, the faint marks of its bruising and its fall; and all men can see them clearly.</p>
<p class="TRStarget">那么，月球之船的确非常好看，大地上充满了纤细的光和深邃的快速移动的阴影，灿烂的梦想带着凉爽的翅膀环游世界，但罗瑞恩在他的快乐中也有露丝，因为他的花还带着，也将永远带着伤痕和凋零的痕迹；所有的人都可以清楚地看到它们。</p>
<p class="TRSorigin">But<span id="ch8_en19"><a href="#ch8en19"><sup>19</sup></a></span> lo,’ saith Lindo, ‘I run on ahead, for yet have I only told that the silver ship is newly built, and Ilinsor yet but first stepped aboard—and now do the Gods draw that vessel once again up the steep sides of old Taniquetil singing as they go songs of Lórien’s folk that long have been dumb in Valinor. Slower was that wayfaring than the lifting of the Ship of Morn, and all the folk strain lustily at the ropes, until Oromë coming harnesses thereto a herd of wild white horses, and thus comes the vessel to the topmost place.</p>
<p class="TRStarget">“但瞧<a href="#ch8en19"><sup>19</sup></a>，”林多说，“我继续往前跑，因为我只告诉过这艘银色船是新建的，而伊林索却是第一次登上了船——现在众神将那艘船再次拉上旧船的陡峭边塔尼魁提尔一边唱一边唱着罗瑞恩的民歌，这些歌曲在维林诺中早已无声无息。这条路比晨曦之船的升起还慢，所有的人都在用绳索奋力拉扯，直到欧洛米驾驭着一群野白马，船就这样到达了最高处。</p>
<p class="TRSorigin">Then behold, the galleon of the Sun is seen afar beating golden from the East, and the Valar marvel to descry the glowing peaks of many a mountain far away, and isles glimmering green in seas once dark. Then cried Ossë:“Look, O Manwë, but the sea is blue, as blue wellnigh as Ilwë that thou lovest！”and“Nay,”said Manwë,“envy we not Ilwë, for the sea is not blue alone, but grey and green and purple, and most beauteous-flowered with foaming white. Nor jade nor amethyst nor porphyry set with diamonds and with pearls outrival the waters of the Great and little seas when the sunlight drenches them.”</p>
<p class="TRStarget">然后看哪，太阳的大帆船从东方远处跳动着金色，而维拉惊叹于描述远处许多山峰的发光，以及曾经黑暗的海洋中闪烁着绿色的小岛。然后欧西喊道：“看，曼威啊，但大海是蓝色的，和你所爱的伊尔威一样蓝！”“不，”曼威说，“我们不羡慕伊尔威，因为大海不仅是蓝色的，而且是灰色、绿色和紫色，最美丽的花朵是白色的泡沫。当阳光普照大海和小海的水域时，镶嵌钻石和珍珠的翡翠、紫水晶和斑岩都比不上。”</p>
<p class="TRSorigin">So saying Manwë sent Fionwë his son, swiftest of all to move about the airs, and bade him say to Urwendi that the bark of the Sun come back awhile to Valinor, for the Gods have counsels for her ear; and Fionwë fled most readily, for he had conceived a great love for that bright maiden long ago, and her loveliness now, when bathed in fire she sate as the radiant mistress of the Sun, set him aflame with the eagerness of the Gods. So was it that Urwendi brought her ship unwilling above Valinor, and Oromë cast a noose of gold about it, and it was drawn slowly down upon the Earth, and behold, the woods upon Taniquetil glowed once more in the mingled light of silver and of gold, and all were minded of the ancient blending of the Trees; but Ilsaluntë paled before the galleon of the Sun till almost it seemed to burn no more. So ended the first day upon the world, and it was very long and full of <a href="#l31">many marvellous deeds</a> that Gilfanon may tell; but now the Gods beheld the evening deepen over the world as the Sunship was drawn down and the glow upon the mountains faded, and the sparkle of the seas went out. Then the primeval darkness crept out again once more from many stealthy lairs, but Varda was <a id="page195"></a>glad to see the steady shining of the stars. <a href="#p195v">Far upon the plain was Sári drawn</a>, and when she was gone Ilsaluntë was haled upon the topmost peak so that his white lucency fell out thence over the wide world and the first night was come. Indeed in these days darkness is no more within the borders of the world, but only night, and night is another and a different thing, by reason of the Rose of Silpion.</p>
<p class="TRStarget">因此，曼威派他的儿子菲昂威以最快的速度在空中移动，并吩咐他对阿瑞恩说，太阳的树皮会在一段时间内回到维林诺，因为众神有她的建议。菲昂威最轻松地逃跑了，因为他很久以前就对那个聪明的少女怀有深深的爱意，而现在她的可爱，当沐浴在火焰中时，她就像太阳的光芒四射的执掌者一样，让他因众神的热切而燃烧起来。阿瑞恩不情愿地把她的船带到维林诺上空，欧洛米用金绞索套住它，它慢慢地被拉到大地上，看哪，塔尼克提尔上的树林再次在银光和银光的交融中闪闪发光。黄金，所有人都想到了古老的树木混合；但伊尔萨伦特在太阳的大帆船面前脸色苍白，几乎不再燃烧。来到世界的第一天就这样结束了，很长，充满了吉尔法农可以讲述的许多奇妙的事迹。但是现在众神看到，随着太阳船被拉下，世界上的夜色越来越深，山上的光芒消失了，海洋的光芒也消失了。然后原始的黑暗再次从许多隐秘的巢穴中爬出，但瓦尔妲很高兴看到星星的稳定闪耀。远处的平原上画着莎莉，她走后，伊尔萨伦特被拖到最高峰，他的白光从那里消失在广阔的世界上，第一个夜晚来临了。事实上，在这些日子里，黑暗不再是世界的边界，而只有黑夜，而黑夜是另一回事，因为罗瑞恩玫瑰而不同。</p>
<p class="TRSorigin">Now however does Aulë fill the brimming vessel of that flower with white radiance, and many of the Súruli white-winged glide beneath and bear it slowly up and set it among the company of the stars. There does it swim slowly, a pale and glorious thing, and Ilinsor and his comrades sit them upon its rim and with shimmering oars urge it bravely through the sky; and Manwë breathed upon its bellying sails till it was wafted far away, and the beat of the unseen oars against the winds of night faded and grew faint.</p>
<p class="TRStarget">然而，现在奥力用白色的光辉充满了那朵花的充满容器，许多 Súruli 白翅滑翔在下面，慢慢地把它举起来，放在群星之中。它在那里缓缓游动，苍白而光彩夺目，伊林索和他的伙伴们坐在它的边缘，用闪闪发光的桨勇敢地推动它穿过天空；曼威靠在它腹部的帆上呼吸，直到它飘到很远的地方，看不见的桨在夜风中的节拍逐渐消退，变得微弱。</p>
<p class="TRSorigin">Of this manner was the first rising of the Moon above Taniquetil, and Lórien rejoiced, but Ilinsor was <span id="p_195aa">jealous of the supremacy of the Sun</span>, and he bade the starry mariners flee before him and the constellate lamps go out, but many would not, and often he set sail in chase of them, and the little ships of Varda fled before the huntsman of the firmament, and were not caught:—and that, said Lindo, ‘is all, methinks, I know to tell of the building of those marvellous ships and their launching on the air.’<span id="ch8_en20"><a href="#ch8en20"><sup>20</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="TRStarget">月亮在塔尼克提尔上空的第一次升起就是这样，罗瑞恩很高兴，但伊林索尔嫉妒太阳的霸权，他吩咐满天星斗的水手们在他面前逃走，星座灯熄灭，但许多人不肯。他经常启航追赶他们，而瓦尔妲的小船在天空中的猎人面前逃跑，没有被抓住：——林多说，“我想，我只知道建造那些奇妙的船只及其在空中发射。”<a href="#ch8en20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p class="TRSorigin">‘But,’ said Eriol, ‘nay, surely that is not so, for at the tale’s beginning methought you promised us words concerning the present courses of the Sun and Moon and their rising in the East, and I for one, by the leave of the others here present am not minded to release you of your word.’</p>
<p class="TRStarget">“但是，”埃利欧尔说，“不，肯定不是这样，因为在故事的开头，你以为你答应过我们关于太阳和月亮目前的运行方向以及它们在东方升起的话语，就我个人而言，经在场其他人的许可，我不介意解除你的话。”</p>
<p class="TRSorigin">Then quoth Lindo laughing, ‘Nay, I remember not the promise, and did I make it then it was rash indeed, for the things you ask are nowise easy to relate, and many matters concerning the deeds in those days in Valinor are hidden from all save only the Valar. Now however am I fain rather to listen, and thou Vairë perchance will take up the burden of the tale.’</p>
<p class="TRStarget">然后林多笑着说：“不，我不记得承诺了，我当时是不是真的很轻率，因为你问的事情现在很容易说出来，而且很多关于维林诺那些日子的事迹的事情都是隐瞒的。所有人都只保存维拉。不过现在我更愿意听，而你薇瑞可能会承担这个故事的重担。”</p>
<p class="TRSorigin">Thereat did all rejoice, and the children clapped their hands, for dearly did they love those times when Vairë was the teller of the tale; but Vairë said:</p>
<p class="TRStarget">那时，所有人都欢呼雀跃，孩子们拍手称快，因为他们非常热爱薇瑞讲述故事的那些时光。但薇瑞说：</p>
<p class="TRSorigin">‘Lo, tales I tell of the deep days, and the first is called <em>The Hiding of Valinor</em>.’</p>

<li><span class="TRSorigin"><span id="ch8en06"><a href="#ch8_en06">6</a></span> The rejected form of the ‘interlude’ is quite different in its latter part:<br/><br/>Therefore said Lindo in answer to Eriol: ‘Behold, Gilfanon here can tell you much of such matters, but first of all must you be told of the deeds that were done in Valinor when Melko slew the Trees and the Gnomes marched away into the darkness. ’Tis a long tale but well worth the hearkening.’ For Lindo loved to tell such tales and sought often an occasion for recalling them; but Gilfanon said: ‘Speak on, my Lindo, but methinks the tale will not be told tonight or for many a night after, and I shall have fared long back to Tavrobel.’ ‘Nay,’ said Lindo, ‘I will not make the tale overlong, and tomorrow shall be all your own.’ And so saying Gilfanon sighed, but <span id="l17"><a href="#l_17">Lindo lifted up his voice</a></span>…</span>

因此，林多回答埃利欧尔说：“看哪，吉尔法农在这里可以告诉你很多这样的事情，但首先必须告诉你，当米尔冦杀死双圣树和诺多进入黑暗时在维林诺所做的事迹 . 这是一个很长的故事，但很值得听。”因为林多喜欢讲述这样的故事，并经常寻找机会回忆它们。 但吉尔法农说：“说吧，我的林多，但我想这个故事今晚或之后的许多个晚上都不会被讲述，而且我早就回到塔夫罗贝尔了。” “不，”林多说，“我不会做，故事太长了，明天将是你自己的。”吉尔法农这么说着叹了口气，但林多提高了声音……</span></li>

In fact, to the end of the <em>Tale of the Sun and Moon</em> the differences are slight, no more than alterations of wording; but the original text does explain the fact that at the first occurrence of the name <em><span id="l30">Gilfanon</span></em> on p. 189 the original reading was <em>Ailios</em>. One would guess in any case that this was a slip, a reversion to an earlier name, and that this is so is shown by the first version, which has, for ‘<span id="l31">many marvellous deeds</span> that Gilfanon may tell’ (p. 194), ‘many marvellous deeds as <span id="l_197-19">Ailios shall tell’</span>.</span><span class="TRStarget">
19 从这一点开始，日月传说的文本不再被写在被擦掉的铅笔原件上，并且从同一点开始，原始文本存在于另一本书中。事实上，到日月传说的结尾，差别很小，只不过是措辞上的改变而已。但原文确实解释了一个事实，即在第一次出现 Gilfanon 这个名字时 p。189 原读是 Ailios。在任何情况下，人们都会猜测这是一个错误，是对早期名称的回归，并且第一个版本表明了这一点，该版本具有“Gilfanon 可能讲述的许多奇妙的事迹”（第 194 页），“艾利奥斯将讲述许多奇妙的事迹”。</span></li>
<li><span class="TRSorigin"><span id="ch8en20"><a href="#ch8_en20">20</a></span> From this point the second version diverges sharply from the first. The first reads as follows:<br/><br/>And that is all, methinks,’ said Lindo, ‘that I know to tell of those fairest works of the Gods’ but Ailios said: ‘Little doth it cost thee to spin the tale, an it be of Valinor; it is a while since ye offered us a…..tale concerning the rising of the Sun and Moon in the East, and a flow of speech has poured from thee since then, but now art thou minded to [?tease], and no word of that promise.’ Of a truth Ailios beneath his roughness liked the words of Lindo as well as any, and he was eager to learn of the matter.<br/>     <span id="l_32">‘That is easy told,’ said Lindo</span>…<br/>What follows in the original version relates to the matter of the next chapter (see p. 220 note 2).<br/>     <span id="l_63">Ailios here claims</span> that a promise made by Lindo has not been fulfilled, just as does Eriol, more politely, in the second version. The beginning of the tale in the first version is not extant, and perhaps as it was originally written Lindo did make this promise; but in the second he says no such thing (indeed Eriol’s question was ‘Whence be the Sun and Moon?’), and at the end of his tale denies that he had done so, when Eriol asserts it.</span><span class="TRStarget">从这一点来看，第二个版本与第一个版本大相径庭。第一个内容如下：
<br/>
我想，”林多说，“我知道要讲述的就是诸神最美丽的作品，这就是全部，”但艾利奥斯说：很久没有给我们讲过一个关于东方的太阳和月亮升起的故事了，从那时起你就滔滔不绝地滔滔不绝，但现在你想[？取笑]，没有说实话，在他粗鲁之下的艾利奥斯喜欢林多的话，就像任何人一样，他很想知道这件事。
 <br/>    “这很容易说，”林多说……
原始版本中的内容与下一章的内容有关（参见第 220 页注 2）。
 <br/>    Ailios 在这里声称 Lindo 的承诺没有兑现，就像 Eriol 在第二个版本中更礼貌地所做的那样。第一个版本中故事的开头并不存在，也许正如最初写的那样，林多确实做出了这个承诺。但在第二个中，他没有说这样的话（事实上，埃利欧尔的问题是“太阳和月亮是从哪里来的？”），在他的故事结束时，当埃利欧尔断言时，他否认他这样做了。</span></li>

<h2 id="chapterheada8">Commentary on<em>The Tale of the Sun and Moon</em></h2>
<p class="TRSorigin">The effect of the opening of this tale is undoubtedly to emphasize more strongly than in the later accounts the horror aroused by the deeds of the Noldoli (notable is Aulë’s bitterness against them, of which nothing is said afterwards), and also the finality and absoluteness of their exclusion from Valinor. But the idea that some Gnomes remained in Valinor (the Aulenossë, p. 176) survived; cf. <em>The Silmarillion</em> p. 84:</p>
<p class="TRStarget">这个故事开头的效果无疑比后来的叙述更强烈地强调了诺多的行为所引起的恐惧（值得注意的是奥力对他们的怨恨，后来没有说出来），以及结局和绝对性将他们排除在维林诺之外。但是一些诺姆留在维林诺的想法（Aulenossë，第 176 页）幸免于难。参看。精灵宝钻 p. 84:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="TRSorigin">And of all the Noldor in Valinor, who were grown now to a great people, but one tithe refused to take the road: some for the love that they bore to the Valar (and to Aulë not least), some for the love of Tirion and the many things that they had made; none for fear of peril by the way.</p>
<p class="TRStarget">在维林诺的所有诺多族中，他们现在已经成长为一个伟大的民族，但十分之一拒绝走这条路：有些是因为他们对维拉（尤其是奥力）的爱，有些是为了提力安的爱以及他们所造的许多东西；顺便说一句，因为害怕危险，所以没有。</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="TRSorigin">Sorontur’s mission and the tidings that he brought back were to be abandoned. Very striking is his account of the empty ships drifting, of which ‘some were burning with bright fires’: the origin of Fëanor’s burning of the ships of the Teleri at Losgar in <em>The Silmarillion</em> (p. 90), where however there is a more evident reason for doing so. That Melko’s second dwelling-place in the Great Lands was distinct from Utumna is here expressly stated, as also that it was in the Iron Mountains (cf. p. 149, 158); the name <em>Angamandi</em> ‘Hells of Iron’ has occurred once in the <em>Lost Tales</em>, in the very strange account of the fate of Men after death (p. 77). In later accounts Angband was built on the site of Utumno, but finally they were separated again, and in <em>The Silmarillion</em> Angband had existed from ancient days before the captivity of Melkor (p. 47). It is not explained in the present tale why p. 104).</p>
<p class="TRStarget">Sorontur 的任务和他带回的消息都将被放弃。非常引人注目的是他对漂流的空船的描述，其中“一些正在燃烧着明亮的火焰”：费艾诺在《精灵宝钻》（第 90 页）中在洛斯加焚烧泰勒瑞的船只的起源，然而在那里还有更多这样做的明显理由。此处明确指出，米尔冦在大地的第二个住所不同于乌图姆诺，它也位于铁山（参见第 149、158 页）； Angamandi ‘Hells of Iron’这个名字曾经在失落的故事中出现过，在对人类死后命运的非常奇怪的描述中（第 77 页）。在后来的记载中，安格班建在 Utumno 的遗址上，但最终它们再次分离，在《精灵宝钻》中，安格班早在米尔冦被俘之前就已经存在（第 47 页）。目前的故事没有解释为什么“乌图姆诺再也不会向他开放”（第 176 页），但无疑是因为托卡斯和乌欧牟打破了它的大门，并在上面堆放了石山（第 104 页）。</p>
<p class="TRSorigin">In the next part of the tale (p. 177 ff.) much light is cast on my father’s early conception of the powers and limitations of the great Valar. Thus <a id="page199"></a>Yavanna and Manwë (brought to this realization by Yavanna?) are shown to believe that the Valar have done ill, or at least failed to achieve the wider designs of Ilúvatar (‘I have it in mind that this [time of darkness] is not without the desire of Ilúvatar’): the idea of ‘selfish’, inward-looking Gods is plainly expressed, Gods content to tend their gardens and devise their devisings behind their mountains, leaving ‘the world’ to shape itself as it may. And this realization is an essential element in their conceiving the making of the Sun and Moon, which are to be such bodies as may light not only ‘the blessed realms’ (an expression which occurs here for the first time, p. 182) but all the rest of the dark Earth. Of all this there is only a trace in <em>The Silmarillion</em> (p. 99):</p>
<p class="TRStarget">在故事的下一部分（第 177 页及以下）中，我父亲对伟大维拉的力量和局限性的早期概念得到了很多启示。因此，雅凡娜和曼威（由雅凡娜领悟？）被证明相信维拉做了坏事，或者至少未能实现伊露维塔的更广泛的计划（“我认为这段 [黑暗时期] 是并非没有伊露维塔的愿望）：“自私”的想法，内向的众神被清楚地表达出来，众神满足于照料他们的花园并在他们的山脉后面设计他们的设计，让“世界”尽可能地塑造自己。这种认识是他们构想创造太阳和月亮的基本要素，它们不仅可以照亮“幸福的领域”（第一次出现在这里的表述，第 182 页），而且所有其余的黑暗大地。在这一切中，只有《精灵宝钻》（第 99 页）中的痕迹：</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="TRSorigin">These things the Valar did, recalling in their twilight the darkness of the lands of Arda; and they resolved now to illumine Middle-earth and with light to hinder the deeds of Melkor.</p>
<p class="TRStarget">维拉做了这些事，在他们的暮光中回忆起阿尔达大陆的黑暗；他们现在决定照亮中洲，用光来阻止米尔冦的行动。</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="TRSorigin">Of much interest also is the ‘theological’ statement in the early narrative concerning the binding of the Valar to the World as the condition of their entering it (p. 182); cf. <em>The Silmarillion</em> p. 20:</p>
<p class="TRStarget">早期叙述中关于维拉与世界的结合是他们进入世界的条件的“神学”陈述也很有趣（第 182 页）；参看。精灵宝钻 p. 20：</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="TRSorigin">But this condition Ilúvatar made, or it is the necessity of their love, that their power should thenceforward be contained and bounded in the World, to be within it for ever, until it is complete, so that they are its life and it is theirs.</p>
<p class="TRStarget">但是伊露维塔提出的这个条件，或者说这是他们爱的必然性，他们的力量应该从那时起被包含并限制在世界中，永远在世界之内，直到它完成，这样他们就是它的生命，它是他们的.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="TRSorigin">In the tale this condition is an express physical limitation: none of the Valar, save Manwë and Varda and their attendant spirits, could pass into the higher airs above Vilna, though they could move at great speed within the lowest air.</p>
<p class="TRStarget">在这个故事中，这种情况是一种明确的身体限制：除了曼威和瓦尔妲以及他们的随从精神之外，没有任何一个维拉可以进入Vilna上方的高空，尽管他们可以在最低的空气中以极快的速度移动。</p>
<p class="TRSorigin">From the passage on p. 178, where it is said that Ulmo, despite his love for the Solosimpi and grief at the Kinslaying, was yet not filled with anger against the Noldoli, for he ‘<a href="#l_41">was foreknowing</a> more than all the Gods, even than great Manwë’, it is seen that Ulmo’s peculiar concern for the exiled Eldar—which plays such an important if mysterious part in the development of the story—was there from the beginning; as also was Yavanna’s thought, expressed in <em>The Silmarillion</em> p. 78:</p>
<p class="TRStarget">从第页的段落。178，据说乌欧牟虽然热爱梭洛辛佩，也对杀戮者感到悲伤，但他并没有对诺多族充满愤怒，因为他“比所有的神灵，甚至比伟大的曼威都预知更多”，它是看到乌欧牟对被放逐的精灵族——在故事的发展中扮演着如此重要但又神秘的角色——的特殊关心从一开始就存在；就像雅凡娜的想法一样，在《精灵宝钻》第 78 页中表达。</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="TRSorigin">Even for those who are mightiest under Ilúvatar there is some work that they may accomplish once, and once only. The Light of the Trees I brought into being, and within Eä I can do so never again.</p>
<p class="TRStarget">即使对于那些在伊露维塔手下最强大的人来说，他们也可以完成一些工作，而且只能完成一次。树之光是我创造出来的，而在 Eä 之内，我再也不能这样做了。</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="TRSorigin">Yavanna’s reference to the Magic Sun and its relighting (which has appeared in the toast drunk in the evening in the Cottage of Lost Play, p. 17, 65) is obviously intended to be obscure at this stage.</p>
<p class="TRStarget">雅凡娜提到的魔法太阳和它的重新点燃（它出现在失落的小屋晚上喝醉的吐司中，第 17、65 页）显然是为了在这个阶段模糊不清。</p>
<p class="TRSorigin">There is no later reference to the story of the wastage of light by Lórien and Vána, pouring it over the roots of the Trees unavailingly.</p>
<p class="TRStarget">后来没有提到罗瑞恩和瓦娜浪费光的故事，将光倾倒在树的根部无济于事。</p>
<a id="page200"></a>
<p class="TRSorigin">Turning to Lindo’s account of the stars (p. 114), with the story that Varda dropped it ‘as she fared in great haste back to Valinor’, and that it ‘blazes above the world’s edge in the west’ in the present tale Morwinyon (which according to both the Qenya and Gnomish word-lists is Arcturus) is again strangely represented as being a luminary always of the western sky. It is said here that while some of the stars were guided by the Mánir and the Súruli ‘on mazy courses’, others, including Morwinyon and Nielluin, ‘abode where they hung and moved not’. Is the explanation of this that in the ancient myths of the Elves there was a time when the regular apparent movement of all the heavenly bodies from East to West had not yet begun? This movement is nowhere explained mythically in my father’s cosmology.</p>
<p class="TRStarget">谈到林多对星星的描述（第 181-2 页），莫温扬曾出现在一个较早的故事中（第 114 页），其中讲述了瓦尔妲“匆匆赶回维林诺”时放弃了它的故事，并且它在现在的故事中，“在西方世界的边缘闪耀”Morwinyon（根据昆雅语和诺姆语的词汇表都是大角星）再次被奇怪地描绘成西方天空的光辉。据说这里的一些星星是由 Mánir 和 Súruli 引导的“在迷宫般的路线上”，而其他一些星星，包括 Morwinyon 和赫尔路因，则“住在他们悬挂和移动的地方”。这是否解释了在古代精灵神话中，所有天体从东到西的有规律的明显运动还没有开始的时候？这个运动在我父亲的宇宙学中没有任何神秘的解释。</p>
<p class="TRSorigin">Nielluin (‘Blue Bee’) is Sirius (in <em>The Silmarillion</em> called <em>Helluin</em>), and this star had a place in the legend of Telimektar son of Tulkas, though the story of his conversion into the constellation of Orion was never clearly told (cf. <em>Telumehtar</em> ‘Orion’ in <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> Appendix E, I). Nielluin was Inwë’s son Ingil, who followed Telimektar ‘in the likeness of a great bee bearing honey of flame’ (see the Appendix on Names under <em>Ingil</em> and <em>Telimektar</em>).</p>
<p class="TRStarget">赫尔路因（“蓝蜂”）是西瑞安（在《精灵宝钻》中称为 Helluin），这颗星在托卡斯的儿子泰理梅克塔的传说中占有一席之地，尽管他转变为猎户座的故事从未被清楚地讲述过（cf. Telumehtar 'Orion' 在指环王附录 E，I）中。赫尔路因是 Inwë 的儿子 Ingil，他跟随泰理梅克塔，“就像一只携带火焰蜂蜜的大蜜蜂”（参见 Ingil 和泰理梅克塔下的名字附录）。</p>
<p class="TRSorigin">The course of the Sun and Moon between East and West (rather than in some other direction) is here given a rationale, and the reason for avoiding the South is Ungweliant’s presence there. This seems to give Ungweliant a great importance and also a vast area subject to her power of absorbing light. It is not made clear in the tale of <em>The Darkening of Valinor</em> where her dwelling was. It is said (p. 151) that Melko wandered ‘the dark plains of Eruman, and farther south than anyone yet had penetrated he found a region of the deepest gloom’—the region where he found the cavern of Ungweliant, which had ‘a subterranean outlet on the sea’ and after the destruction of the Trees Ungweliant ‘gets her gone southward and over the mountains to her home’ (p. 154). It is impossible to tell from the vague lines on the little map (p. 81) what was at this time the configuration of the southern lands and seas.</p>
<p class="TRStarget">东方和西方之间的太阳和月亮的运行（而不是其他方向）在这里给出了一个基本原理，而避开南方的原因是 Ungweliant 在那里的存在。这似乎赋予了 Ungweliant 一个非常重要的地位，也赋予了她吸收光线能力的广阔区域。在维林诺的黑暗的故事中并没有明确她的住所在哪里。据说（第 151 页）米尔冦在“Eruman 的黑暗平原上徘徊，他发现了一个比任何人都深入的更南边的区域”——他发现了 Ungweliant 洞穴的区域，那里有“一个海上的地下出口”，在树木被破坏后，Ungweliant“让她向南走，越过山脉回到她的家”（第 154 页）。从小地图（第 81 页）上模糊的线条无法分辨出此时南方陆地和海洋的构造。</p>
<p class="TRSorigin">In comparison with the last part of the tale, concerning the last fruit of Laurelin and the last flower of Silpion, the making from them of the Sun and Moon, and the launching of their vessels (<a href="#p_183v">p. 183–95</a>), Chapter XI of <em>The Silmarillion</em> (constituted from two later versions not greatly dissimilar the one from the other) is extremely brief. Despite many differences the later versions read in places almost as summaries of the early story, but it is often hard to say whether the shortening depends rather on my father’s feeling (certainly present, see <a href="#p_174v">p. 174</a>) that the description was too long, was taking too large a place in the total structure, or an actual rejection of some of the ideas it contains, and a desire to diminish the extreme ‘concreteness’ of its images. Certainly there is here a revelling in materials of ‘magic’ property, gold, silver, crystal, glass, and above all light conceived as a liquid element, or as dew, as honey, an element that can be bathed in and gathered into vessels, that has quite <a id="page201"></a>largely disappeared from <em>The Silmarillion</em> (although, of course, the idea of light as liquid, dripping down, poured and hoarded, sucked up by Ungoliant, remained essential to the conception of the Trees, this idea becomes in the later writing less palpable and the divine operations are given less ‘physical’ explanation and justification).</p>
<p class="TRStarget">与故事的最后一部分相比，关于劳瑞林的最后一个果实和熙尔皮安的最后一朵花，由它们制造太阳和月亮，以及它们的船只下水（第 183-95 页），第 XI 章精灵宝钻lion（由两个后来的版本组成，与另一个版本相差无几）非常简短。尽管有许多不同之处，后来的版本在某些地方读起来几乎是早期故事的摘要，但通常很难说缩短是否取决于我父亲的感觉（当然存在，见第 174 页），即描述太长，是在整个结构中占据了太大的位置，或者实际上拒绝了它所包含的一些想法，并且渴望减少其图像的极端“具体性”。当然，这里有一种“魔法”材料的陶醉，金、银、水晶、玻璃，尤其是被设想为液体元素的光，或者是露水、蜂蜜，一种可以沐浴并收集到容器中的元素，这在《精灵宝钻》中已经基本消失了（当然，光作为液体的想法，滴落、倾倒和囤积，被 Ungoliant 吸干，仍然是树的概念必不可少的，这个想法在后来的写作中成为不那么明显，神圣的运作也没有得到更少的“物理”解释和证明）。</p>
<p class="TRSorigin">As a result of this fullness and intensity of description, the origin of the Sun and Moon in the last fruit and last flower of the Trees has less of mystery than in the succinct and beautiful language of <em>The Silmarillion</em>; but also much is said here to emphasize the great size of the ‘Fruit of Noon’, and the increase in the heat and brilliance of the Sunship after its launching, so that the reflection rises less readily that if the Sun that brilliantly illumines the whole Earth was but one fruit of Laurelin then Valinor must have been painfully bright and hot in the days of the Trees. In the early story the last outpourings of life from the dying Trees are utterly strange and ‘enormous’, those of Laurelin portentous, even ominous; the Sun is astoundingly bright and hot even to the Valar, who are awestruck and disquieted by what has been done (the Gods knew ‘that <a href="#l_42">they had done a greater thing</a> than they at first knew’, p. 190); and the anger and distress of certain of the Valar at the burning light of the Sun enforces the feeling that in the last fruit of Laurelin a terrible and unforeseen power has been released. This distress does indeed survive in <em>The Silmarillion</em> (p. 100), in the reference to ‘the prayers of Lórien and Estë, who said that sleep and rest had been banished from the Earth, and the stars were hidden’ but in the tale the blasting power of the new Sun is intensely conveyed in the images of ‘the heat dancing above the trees’ in the gardens of Lórien, the silent nightingales, the withered poppies and the drooping evening flowers.</p>
<p class="TRStarget">由于描述的充分性和强度，太阳和月亮的起源在树的最后一个果实和最后一朵花中没有那么神秘，而是在《精灵宝钻》中简洁而美丽的语言中；但这里也有很多话是为了强调“正午之果”的巨大尺寸，以及太阳船发射后热量和亮度的增加，这样反射就不会那么容易升起，如果太阳耀眼地照亮了整个大地只是劳瑞林的一种果实，那么维林诺在树的时代一定是痛苦的明亮和炎热。在早期的故事中，垂死之树最后的生命倾泻而出是完全奇怪和“巨大的”，劳瑞林的那些是不祥的，甚至是不祥的；甚至对维拉来说，太阳也是惊人的明亮和炽热，他们对所做的事情感到敬畏和不安（众神知道“他们所做的事情比他们最初所知道的更伟大”，第 190 页）；某些维拉对烈日的灼热感到愤怒和痛苦，这使人们更加强烈地感觉到，在劳瑞林的最后果实中，一种可怕的、不可预见的力量已经释放出来。这种痛苦确实存在于《精灵宝钻》（第 100 页）中，在提到“罗瑞恩和 Estë 的祈祷中，他们说睡眠和休息已经从大地上消失了，星星也被隐藏了”，但在故事中新太阳的爆发力在洛里恩花园中的“树上舞动的热浪”、沉默的夜莺、枯萎的罂粟和下垂的晚花中得到了强烈的体现。</p>
<p class="TRSorigin">In the old story there is a mythical explanation of the Moon’s phases (though not of eclipses), and of the markings on its face through the story of the breaking of the withered bough of Silpion and the fall of the Moonflower—a story altogether at variance with the explanation given in <em>The Silmarillion</em> (<em>ibid</em>.). In the tale the fruit of Laurelin also fell to the ground, when Aulë stumbled and its weight was too great for Tulkas to bear alone: the significance of this event is not made perfectly clear, but it seems that, had the Fruit of Noon not burst asunder, Aulë would not have understood its structure and conceived that of the Sunship.</p>
<p class="TRStarget">在古老的故事中，通过熙尔皮安的枯枝折断和 Moonflower 的坠落的故事，对月相（虽然不是日食）和月相上的标记进行了神话般的解释——这个故事完全在与 The精灵宝钻lion (ibid.) 中给出的解释不一致。在传说中，劳瑞林的果实也掉到了地上，当奥力绊倒时，它的重量太大，托卡斯一个人无法承受：这件事的意义并没有完全清楚，但似乎，如果没有中午的果实炸裂，奥力不会理解它的结构并构想出太阳船的结构。</p>
<p class="TRSorigin">To whatever extent the great differences between the versions in this part of the Mythology may be due to later compression, there remain a good many actual contradictions, of which I note here only some of the more important, in addition to that concerning the markings on the Moon already mentioned. Thus in <em>The Silmarillion</em> the Moon rose first, ‘and was the elder of the new lights as was Telperion of the Trees’ (<em>ibid</em>.); in the old story the reverse is true both of the Trees and of the new lights. Again, in <em>The Silmarillion</em> it is Varda who decides their motions, and she changes these from her first plan at the plea of Lórien and Estë, whereas here it is Lórien’s very distress at the coming of Sunlight that leads to the <a id="page202"></a>last blossoming of Silpion and the making of the Moon. The Valar indeed play different roles throughout; and here far greater importance attaches to the acts of Vána and Lórien, whose relations with the Sun and Moon are at once deeper and more explicit than they afterwards became, as they had been with the Trees (see p. 71); in <em>The Silmarillion</em> it was Nienna who watered the Trees with her tears (p. 98). In <em>The Silmarillion</em> the Sun and Moon move nearer to Arda than ‘the ancient stars’ (p. 99), but here they move at quite different levels in the firmament.</p>
<p class="TRStarget">不管这部分神话版本之间的巨大差异可能是由于后来的压缩造成的，但仍然存在许多实际的矛盾，我在这里只指出一些更重要的矛盾，除了关于月亮已经提到了。因此，在《精灵宝钻》中，月亮首先升起，“并且是新光中的长者，就像树木的泰尔佩瑞安一样”（同上）；在旧故事中，树木和新灯都相反。再一次，在《精灵宝钻》中，瓦尔妲决定了他们的行动，她在罗瑞恩和埃斯特的请求下改变了她的第一个计划，而在这里，正是罗瑞恩对阳光来临的极度痛苦导致了罗瑞恩和月球的形成。维拉确实在整个过程中扮演着不同的角色。在这里，瓦娜和罗瑞恩的行为更加重要，他们与太阳和月亮的关系比后来变得更加深刻和明确，就像他们与树木一样（见第 71 页）。在《精灵宝钻》中，涅娜用她的眼泪浇灌了树木（第 98 页）。在《精灵宝钻》中，太阳和月亮比“古老的星星”（第 99 页）更靠近阿尔达，但在这里它们在天空中移动的高度完全不同。</p>
<p class="TRSorigin">But a feature in which later compression can be certainly discerned is the elaborate description in the tale of the Moon as ‘an island of pure glass’, ‘a shimmering isle’, with little lakes of the light from Telimpë bordered with shining flowers and a crystalline cup amidmost in which was set the Moonflower; only from this is explicable the reference in <em>The Silmarillion</em> to Tilion’s steering ‘the island of the Moon’. The aged Elf Uolë and Erinti’ in the little pocket-book used among things for suggestions of stories to be told (see p. 171) no doubt implies that a tale was preparing on the subject of Uolë cf. the Tale of Qorinórmi concerning Urwendi and Erinti’s brother Fionwë (p. 215). No traces of these tales are to be found and they were presumably never written. Another note in the pocket-book calls Uolë Mikúmi (the earlier name of Uolë Kúvion, see p. 198) ‘King of the Moon’ and a third refers to a poem ‘The Man in the Moon’ which is to be sung by Eriol, ‘who says he will sing them a song of a legend touching Uolë Mikúmi as Men have it’. My father wrote a poem about the Man in the Moon in March 1915, but if it was this that he was thinking of including it would have startled the company of Mar Vanwa Tyaliéva—and he would have had to change its references to places in England which were not yet in existence. Although it is very probable that he had something quite different in mind, I think it may be of interest to give this poem in an early form (see p. 204).</p>
<p class="TRStarget">但是可以肯定地看出后来压缩的一个特征是月亮的故事中详细描述为“纯玻璃岛”，“闪闪发光的小岛”，Telimpe的小湖光与闪亮的花朵和晶莹的杯中，镶嵌着月花；只有这样才可以解释《精灵宝钻》中提力安指挥“月亮岛”的说法。年迈的精灵 Uolë Kúvion（“确实有人​​将其称为月球上的人”）似乎几乎偏离了另一个概念；在任何情况下，他的存在都会带来困难，因为我们刚刚被告知（第 192 页）熙尔牟不能在月球飞船上航行，因为他不是空气之子，不能“净化他的大地性”。小皮夹中的一个单独的标题“Uolë 和 Erinti”用于建议要讲述的故事（见第 171 页），这无疑暗示着一个关于 Uolë 主题的故事正在准备中。Qorinórmi 关于阿瑞恩和 Erinti 的兄弟菲昂威的故事（第 215 页）。找不到这些故事的踪迹，而且可能从未写过。袖珍本中的另一个注释称 Uolë Mikúmi（Uolë Kúvion 的早期名字，见第 198 页）为“月亮之王”，第三个则指的是由埃利欧尔演唱的一首诗“The Man in the Moon”, '谁说他会给他们唱一首传说中的歌，触动人类拥有的 Uolë Mikúmi'。我父亲在 1915 年 3 月写了一首关于月球上的人的诗，但如果他想把这首诗写进去，那会惊动 Mar Vanwa Tyaliéva 的同伴——他将不得不改变它对安格班地方的引用尚不存在。尽管他很可能有完全不同的想法，但我认为以早期形式给出这首诗可能会很有趣（见第 204 页）。</p>
<p class="TRSorigin">As the mythology evolved and changed, the Making of the Sun and Moon became the element of greatest difficulty; and in the published <em>Silmarillion</em> this chapter does not seem of a piece with much of the rest of the work, and could not be made to be so. Towards the end of his life my father was indeed prepared to dismantle much of what he had built, in the attempt to solve what he undoubtedly felt to be a fundamental problem.</p>
<p class="TRStarget">随着神话的演变和变化，日月的形成成为最困难的元素。在已出版的《精灵宝钻》中，这一章似乎与其他大部分作品并不相像，而且不可能如此。在他生命的尽头，我父亲确实准备拆除他所建造的大部分建筑，以试图解决他无疑认为是一个根本问题。</p>
<p class="TRSorigin"><em>Note on the order of the Tales</em></p>
<p class="TRStarget"><em>注意故事的顺序</em></p>
<p class="TRSorigin">The development of the <em>Lost Tales</em> is here in fact extremely complex. After the concluding words of <em>The Flight of the Noldoli</em>, ‘the story of the <a id="page203"></a>darkening of Valinor was at an end’ (p. 169), my father wrote: ‘See on beyond in other books’, but in fact he added subsequently the short dialogue between Lindo and Eriol (‘Great was the power of Melko for ill…’) which is given at the end of <em>The Flight of the Noldoli</em>.</p>
<p class="TRStarget">失落的故事的发展实际上非常复杂。在诺多族的出奔的结束语之后，“维林诺黑暗的故事结束了”（第 169 页），我父亲写道：“在其他书中看到更远的地方”，但事实上他随后补充了Lindo 和埃利欧尔之间的简短对话（“伟大的是米尔冦治疗疾病的力量……”）在诺多族的出奔结束时给出。</p>
<p class="TRSorigin">The page-numbering of the notebooks shows that the next tale was to be the <em>Tale of Tinúviel</em>, which is written in another book. This long story (to be given in Part II), the oldest extant version of ‘Beren and Lúthien’, begins with a long <em>Link</em> passage; and the curious thing is that this <em>Link</em> begins with the very dialogue between Lindo and Eriol just referred to, in almost identical wording, and this can be seen to be its original place; but here it was struck through.</p>
<p class="TRStarget">笔记本的页码显示下一个故事是蒂努维尔的故事，它写在另一本书中。这个长篇故事（将在第二部分给出）是现存最古老的“Beren and露西恩”版本，以一段很长的 Link 段落开始；奇怪的是，这个链接开始于刚才提到的林多和埃利欧尔之间的对话，措辞几乎相同，可以看出这是它的原始位置；但在这里它被击穿了。</p>
<p class="TRSorigin">I have mentioned earlier (p. 45) that in a letter written by my father in 1964 he said that he wrote <em>The Music of the Ainur</em> while working in Oxford on the staff of the Dictionary, a post that he took up in November 1918 and relinquished in the spring of 1920. In the same letter he said that he wrote ‘“The Fall of Gondolin”during sick-leave from the army in 1917’, and ‘the original version of the“Tale of Lúthien Tinúviel and Beren”later in the same year’. There is nothing in the manuscripts to suggest that the tales that follow <em>The Music of the Ainur</em> to the point we have now reached were not written consecutively and continuously from <em>The Music</em>, while my father was still in Oxford.</p>
<p class="TRStarget">我之前提到过（第 45 页），在我父亲 1964 年写的一封信中，他说他在牛津大学的词典工作人员工作时写了《爱努的音乐》，他于 1918 年 11 月担任该职位，1920 年春天放弃。在同一封信中，他说他在 1917 年从军队病假期间写下了“刚多林的陷落”，以及后来的“露西恩·蒂努维尔和贝伦的故事”的原始版本同年”。手稿中没有任何迹象表明，在我父亲还在牛津的时候，《爱努的音乐》之后的故事并不是连续不断地从《音乐》中写出来的。</p>
<p class="TRSorigin">At first sight, then, there is a hopeless contradiction in the evidence: for the <em>Link</em> in question refers explicitly to the Darkening of Valinor, a tale written <em>after</em> his appointment in Oxford at the end of 1918, but is a link to the <em>Tale of Tinúviel</em>, which he said that he wrote in 1917. But the <em>Tale of Tinúviel</em> (and the <em>Link</em> that precedes it) is in fact a text in ink written over an erased pencilled original. It is, I think, certain that this <em>rewriting</em> of <em>Tinúviel</em> was considerably later. It was linked to <em>The Flight of the Noldoli</em> by the speeches of Lindo and Eriol (the link-passage is integral and continuous with the <em>Tale of Tinúviel</em> that follows it, and was not added afterwards). At this stage my father must have felt that the <em>Tales</em> need not necessarily be told in the actual sequence of the narrative (for <em>Tinúviel</em> belongs of course to the time after the making of the Sun and Moon).</p>
<p class="TRStarget">乍一看，证据中有一个无可救药的矛盾：因为所讨论的链接明确指的是维林诺的黑暗，这是一个在他于 1918 年底在牛津被任命后写的故事，但与Tinúviel，他说这是他在 1917 年写的。但 Tinúviel 的故事（以及之前的链接）实际上是用墨水写在已擦除的铅笔原件上的文本。我认为，可以肯定的是，蒂努维尔的这次改写是相当晚的。林多和埃利欧尔的演讲将它与诺多的出奔联系起来（链接通道与随后的蒂努维尔的故事是一体的和连续的，后来没有添加）。在这个阶段，我父亲一定觉得这些故事不一定要按照叙事的实际顺序来讲述（因为蒂努维尔当然属于太阳和月亮形成之后的时间）。</p>
<p class="TRSorigin">The rewritten <em>Tinúviel</em> was followed with no break by a first form of the ‘interlude’ introducing Gilfanon of Tavrobel as a guest in the house, and this led into the <em>Tale of the Sun and Moon</em>. But subsequently my father changed his mind, and so struck out the dialogue of Lindo and Eriol from the beginning of the <em>Link</em> to <em>Tinúviel</em>, which was not now to follow <em>The Flight of the Noldoli</em>, and wrote it out again in the other book at the end of that tale. At the same time he rewrote the Gilfanon ‘interlude’ in an extended form, and placed it at the end of <em>The Flight of the Noldoli</em>. Thus:</p>
<p class="TRStarget">改写的蒂努维尔紧随其后的是第一种形式的“插曲”，介绍了塔芙洛贝尔的吉尔法农作为房子的客人，这导致了日月传说。但后来我父亲改变了主意，因此删除了林多和埃利欧尔的对话，从链接到蒂努维尔开始，现在不是跟随诺多的出奔，并在另一本书中再次写了出来。那个故事的结局。同时，他将吉尔法农的“插曲”改写为加长形式，并将其置于诺多飞翔的结尾。因此：</p>

<p class="TRSorigin">That the rewriting of <em>Tinúviel</em> was one of the latest elements in the composition of the <em>Lost Tales</em> seems clear from the fact that it is followed by the first form of the Gilfanon ‘interlude’, written at the same time: for Gilfanon replaced Ailios, and Ailios, not Gilfanon, is the guest in the house in the earlier versions of the <em>Tale of the Sun and Moon</em> and <em>The Hiding of Valinor</em>, and is the teller of the <em>Tale of the Nauglafring</em>.</p>
<p class="TRStarget">蒂努维尔的改写是《失落的传说》创作的最新元素之一，这一点似乎很明显，因为它紧随其后的是同时写的吉尔法农“插曲”的第一种形式：因为吉尔法农取代了艾利奥斯，并且Ailios，而不是吉尔法农，是早期版本的《太阳与月亮的故事》和《维林诺的隐藏》中的客人，并且是 Nauglafring 的故事的出纳员。</p>

<p class="TRSorigin">The poem about the Man in the Moon exists in many texts, and was published at Leeds in 1923;<a href="footnote37.html" id="footnote37">*</a> long after and much changed it was included in <em>The Adventures of Tom Bombadil</em> (1962). I give it here in a form close to the earlier published version, but with a few (mostly very minor) alterations made subsequently. The 1923 version was only a little retouched from the earliest workings—where it has the title ‘<a href="#l47">Why the Man in the Moon came down too soon</a>: an East Anglian phantasy’ in the first finished text the title is ‘A Faërie: Why the Man in the Moon came down too soon’, together with one in Old English: <em>Se Móncyning</em>.</p>
<p class="TRStarget">关于月球上的人的诗存在于许多文本中，并于 1923 年在利兹出版；* 很久之后并发生了很大变化，它被收录在汤姆·邦巴迪尔历险记（1962 年）中。我在这里给出的形式接近于早期发布的版本，但随后做了一些（大部分是非常小的）改动。1923 年的版本只是对最早的作品进行了一点修饰——它的标题是“为什么月球上的人过早降临：东盎格鲁的幻想”在第一个完成的文本中，标题是“精灵：为什么这个人in the Moon come down too soon'，以及古英语中的一个：Se Móncyning。</p>
